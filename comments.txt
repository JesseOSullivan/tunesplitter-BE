Those first like 18 episodes will forever be the best anime I’ve seen

I still remember the first time I watched SAO. Had a friend recommend it to me cause he knew I liked action shows. Little did I know that it would end up being my favorite anime of all time. I still go back every now and then and rewatch the whole series. Such a fantastic show.

Its 2023 and i cant forget this anime ,its my first anime ,and every time i heard this music its makes me cry🙁 i just love the music i will cherish this anime no matter they said about it

the music in this anime is perfect 😭🙏. Makes everything to calm. Idc what y’all say about this anime this will always be very very special to me

started watching anime in 2020, a close friend recommended me to watch sao. So I binged the whole thing and soon after it became my favorite anime of all time. It&#39;s 2024 now, watched countless amount of anime but nothing hit me more than Sao that&#39;s why I always come back and listen to its ost.

Today’s the day sword art online officially launched🎉

SAO is like this old friend that you visit every now and then. The series literally gets better and better all the way to the ending of Alicization, and I hope the author of the series gets renewed motivation to keep writing and doing more arcs!! People hating on this anime just doesn&#39;t get it, they have no taste. This is awesome, and I can&#39;t rewatch it enough times.

I remember watching SAO as middle schooler now im in college.. and every goddamn time I hear these sao soundtrack, it will always hit different.. idk but.. i just felt like i wanna go back to those times man.. it would always make me cry everytime I feel that...

まじでSAOの曲全部好きだわ、、聞いてるだけで胸が締め付けられてどうしようもなく苦しい気持ちになる。感動ってこんな感情のことを言うんだなと、改めて感じさせてくれる

Hello everyone from 05/31/2022. Recently, or rather on the 22nd, I turned 29. How much time has passed, and still, hearing all this, such indescribable feelings in my soul! Tranquility, peace, love, inspiration, even some kind of .. And much, much more! SAO forever in my heart o_O

I first saw this anime in 2016. It&#39;s now 2023 and I&#39;m not the naive kid I used to be, but my love for SAO hasn&#39;t changed since then. This was the first anime I watched, going back to it will give me motivation.The desire to live. It gives me hope that tomorrow will be better than the most beautiful sunrise I will never see. I forget about the endless routine that haunts me...<br>Sword Art Online, thank you, thank you for my childhood and for the way you extend your hand to me in difficult times...

Immer wenn ich auf irgendeiner Art und Weise nicht mehr mit meinem Leben klarkomme höhre ich diesen Soundtrack...<br>Man merkt bei jedem Song, wie viel emotionen und Leben in all dem steckt, was dieser Anime zu bieten hat...<br>Meiner Meinung nach hat dieser Anime bewiesen, dass man auch mal Glück im Leben haben kann und nicht sofort alles wegwerfen sollte, was man erreicht hat...<br>Für mich ist dieser Anime einer der wichtigsten Wendepunkte meines Lebens gewesen und ich kann mich nur glücklich schätzen dieses emotionale Geflecht und dieses absolute Meisterwerk von Anime erleben zu dürfen...<br>Diese Musik wird auch in Zukunft noch vielen Menschen aus einer schwierigen und depressiven Lage helfen und das einfach nur weil sie dich aufbaut und dir Zuversicht und Hoffnung gibt...<br>Danke an dieser Stelle an den Schriftsteller von SAO und danke an die Menschen, die diese Songs komponiert haben... Mit dieser emotionalen Musik habt ihr es möglich gemacht, dass viele Menschen und auch ich trotz schwerer und schimmer Phasen weiterleben durften... <br>Ihr seid die Menschen, die es anderen Leuten erlaubt haben nicht nur an schlechtes in der Welt zu glauben, indem ihr sie aufbaut...<br>Danke für alles....

This soundtrack makes you remember how you first time watched SAO😊😊😊

whenever i watch this anime, even when i was 11 years old or 21 years old, i still have the same feeling with the first time i&#39;ve reached anime world. So excited with every moments like a child. My first OTP, i would love to watch it 10000 times more.

A few week ago i go to japan and visit differents place who has been seen in sao. When i reach the imperial park garden, i launch this playlist and start to just crying with smile. It&#39;s really, really hard to explain the feeling i have at this moment, but, god, i won&#39;t forget.

One of the most EPIC anime that can never be remade

I used to struggle trying to figure out what my favorite anime was until I found Sword art Online, even the later seasons are still worth watching again

Dulu saya penggemar anime dan manga, pertama menonton anime ini di tahun 2012..<br>Dan saya langsung jatuh cinta, dari semua anime ini yang paling membekas sampai saat ini..<br>Saya sering menontonnya ulang, bahkan di akhir tahun 2023 saya menontonnya hampir 10x, dan buat saya makin penasaran gimana kelanjutan cerita kirito dan Asuna..<br>Saya membaca LN, Manga, dan berita tentang mereka, dan makin penasaran 😢<br>Do&#39;a ku semoga panjang umur, biar bisa melihat kelanjutan cerita kirito dan asuna ❤<br>Sehat selalu buat kita semua😊

one day we will get what we wanted a game like  this

I&#39;m a schizophrenic person and I really love this soundtrack it makes my mind calm. And also as a fan of SAO I always make this sleeping music. ❤❤❤

Wow Its long time, 5 years ago SAO is my first anime i watch and i still remember how feel i got finish the series. <br>Very love SAO series❤️👍😄

Feb 13,2022 but still this music gives me goosebumps . I will forever cherish the excitement SAO gives me . I hope someday before i die i can experience this . 😊

SAO was my first ever anime.  Best decision of my life.  The story, the characters, everything...was amazing.  Still rewatch it from time to time because of how amazing it is

For every person who hates this anime, there is 10 people who love it. I’ve never seen a community so loyal. I love you guys and SAO, and can’t wait for the future. Merry Christmas.

I remember finding this 3 years ago it takes me back to my teenager years

I still remember the period of my life when i first listen to this OST, the moment i started watching my first animes, also the time i fell in love for the first time and had a long relationship, i used to dream about idilic places with this soundtrack in mind (just like kirito and asuna in the lake house). Everytime i listen to this playlist it reminds me of my nostalgic first love in a really pretty and beautiful way. Music is something special...

Sword art online was my first anime and from the first day i saw it, it became my favorite anime out of all time, i def go back now and then and rewatch it. if you have never seen sword art online you def should!

SAO has saved me so much times so has its music I&#39;m grateful

This will be forever be engraved onto my heart &lt;3

Never forget this anime gave me the strength to move forward in the darkest point in my life.

SAO greatest love story ever written. This anime holds a special place in my heart. Its simply superb storytelling, the adventures, the music. Most of all in our hearts we truly fallen in love with these characters. We all secretly wish we could be there with them. Kirito and Asuna and yui chan we love you. Perhaps one dag wei will reincarnate into a world like SAO, it would be something anyways, dont mind me Im emotional atm. Lol 😂 the music got me rn

Para mi, este anime es uno de los mejores que he visto, me hace recordar lo sencilla, hermosa y tranquila es la naturaleza, y lo injusto que es no estar en estos mundos que tanto amor nos han causado. No tengo palabras para describir los sentimientos encontrados que me causo esta maravillosa serie. Por siempre fan de Sword Art Online y de esta compilación de banda sonora.

Sword art online, deep dive will one day be real. I wish I can at least be like Klein. Unless I becime like Kirito or Asuna...

Back at it again on 8/30/22. I have two 8 month old twins now and the rest easy to this music just like their father

I usually come back to SAO every december, just to pass christmas with the characters, much greater feeling on pain when you feel the same atmosphere but sad

i only can say one thing to you,i don&#39;t know who is you but i like you so much,thanks to make me remember good memories.

The best them song ! When I listen this my memories about Kirito and Asuna come to me. I love both of them just like a my old friend for me .I will follow  SAO for only Kirito and Asuna including sword skill that is truly Sword art online!!!!

this is heaven fr

Привет,2024 Мне 20. Когда я первый раз посмотрел SAO, мне было 13. Прослушивая данный плейлист,сразу вспоминаю моменты на каждую мелодию,Это было незабываемо,я будто отправился в чудесное путешествие с Кирито и забыл о собственной реальности. Спасибо автору за сборник. Пишу коментарий и плачу...

Beautiful just beautiful

Sao is the one anime that make me start to love watching anime always waiting for the next season 😊😊😊😊😊😊

This playlist broke my heart

Yo tengo 60 años pero mi apariencia es de uno de 45 perdi a mi madre hace un año y nunca encontrare el verdadero amor y mi soledad es eterna y al escuchar esos temas me da mucha tranquilidad

I remember back in like 2014 when I played nothing but Roblox SAO because i wanted to be in the SAO world so badly and that was the closest i could get to being Kirito

I wish there was a 10 hour loop of this! It&#39;s too good! 😁 ❤️

오랜만에 소드아트온라인을 봐서 그런지 자꾸 이런 노래들을 찾아보게 되네..<br>아스나와 키리토가 22층에서 지내며 서로가, 다 함께 나눈 추억들을 잘 표현하는 bgm이며 듣는이로 하여금 마음을 평온하게 해주는 곡이라 생각한다.

This Anime is very special to me, reminding me of the time when I first started watching Anime and before coming to Japan. Only 3 years, living in Japan but there are so many memories. Just like Kirito&#39;s story in Aincrad, I want to go back there but only memories are left in photos. Everyone I know has gone their separate ways

è stato uno dei primi anime che ho visto e mi ha fatto emozionare la storia d&#39; Amore che c&#39; era tra Kirito ed Asuna, l&#39; entusiasmo di quando c&#39; era il combattimento la felicità di quando lo ho iniziato i brividi per le colonne sonore. <br>grazie SAO che mi ha fatto aprire gli occhi come un ragazzo può essere importante  facendo sbocciare le sue capacità. rimarrai sempre come un amico che mi ha guidato che mi ha fatto emozionare.

tiny love gets me all the time.

An sao is not just anime it&#39;s a memory to me

Hello everyone from 21/11/2023, even after many years after watching SAO, I still listen to this amazing music nonetheless and it keeps me calm

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lRZwEQFP04&amp;t=2193">36:33</a> my favorite....💭❤

24/2-23 back again listening to a masterpiece

So this is the music iv been searching for years lol. Never knew it came from this anime

Yuuki Konna&#39;s death make me cry😢

as an sao fan i can definitely accept most of the criticisms towards the show/movies. they could be better.. and the characters could definitely be flesshed out more. however, i will always consider the music of sao (the openings, endings, and the soundtrack over all) to be a masterpiece nothing short of spectacular. i&#39;ll always remember how lovely this music is. ❤

I love this anime❤😢

Something always happening with this video; copyrighting so it has to be a random song for the full hour, going on and off, comments wise and all other shenanigans but it&#39;s nice to see it&#39;s stood the test of time

I make this playlist as my comfort music whenver i get troubles in life, even if im having trouble sleeping.<br>Oct 11 3:53PM. <br>Ill be back

i love sao so much

This hit the feels

Thank you for rescuing this list from oblivion :3

Love SAO. Brings back memories.

Just love this

Still waiting for a proper good game, an open world battle royale style sword fighting game. Imagine if instead of a leveling system, they have a &quot;floor system&quot; where instead of leveling up, you gain access to the next floor, hence changing BR map and meeting better players. Would be awesome.

my study song of 2020. now anime is boring but memory that watching sao is in my mind

August 3 2022 Wednesday 9:14pm

why is this so FUCKING BEAUTIFUL

I could die while listening to the 1st one

Beautiful

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lRZwEQFP04&amp;t=120">2:00</a> から流れている曲が好きです。

The nostalgia of A tiny love makes my heart cry

commenting to remember to come back every year

i love sao

I&#39;ll admit I&#39;ve cried a few times watching this anime. Very few animes can do that to me. Words can&#39;t explain how good this anime is

I&#39;m Actually watching SAO and I really love the anime it&#39;s so emotional

Reminds me of my late grandmother.

These songs always calm me

Love this music

I rather watching anime than watching stupid drama&#39;s today. Emotional vibe is too different.

I use to be an anime hater and made fun of my friend for watching it the only this I would even consider watching was the fight scene in dragon ball or in avatar the last air bender but one day that friend recommended sao because he said my brain dead ass would like the main character and all the fights little did he know this anime would open my eyes to got incredible anime was and it wasn’t always about the fights but getting attached to the characters and now 8 years later I’ve watched hundreds maybe thousands of anime and it changed my life forever

on the next day is an realy special day for us

im crying now

Б. Ять ностальгия нахлынуло😭😥

There is a game Adventure Quest 3 D. It has different world areas, Class system, Dungeon, monsters and level up system, weapons.

Quiero ser parte de estos soundtrack bonitos por lo menos por aquí por los comentarios ,les digo que dan nostalgia recuerdo cuando miraba SAO por la televisión ya hace años que hermoso

The real masterpiece sao and Franxx love i love this anime i it reminds me how was Great anime and best
