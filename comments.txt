To anybody reading this, I pray that whatever is hurting you or whatever you are constantly stressing about gets better. May the dark thoughts, the overthinking, and the doubt exit your mind may clarity replace confusion. may peace and calmness fill your life.12/11/2023

To the person reading this, Good Luck! Don&#39;t stress, everything will be fine. No matter what difficulty you are facing right now, you can overcome it! You are strong and brave

To everyone who is reading this, <br>make sure to drink water and take breaks as you study or do work, you&#39;ve got this! Good luck! We got this!!!

I&#39;ve been depressed for a long time, I seem useless and bad<br>I am also a musician and music producer and I am also pursuing this genre of music<br>This music has helped me relieve fatigue and stress.<br>Thanks for sharing it<br>The person who is reading this comment , i wish you great success , health, love and happiness !

Good luck everybody with your work, homework, essays and exams &lt;3

I love how everyone is just high and chilling it feels like we’re all friends and we don’t even know eachother

Everyone who reads this, we don&#39;t know each other and probably never will but I wish you all the best in life and all the luck in the world .

This comment section is so wholesomeness I&#39;m literally about to cry. May everyone in this comment section find the happiness they deserve 💕

This music got me through the last stress on my final written exam tonight. Cracked open a nice cold beer and I am currently enjoying the relief and the night. I can feel the summer coming.<br><br>You&#39;ve come this far, you got this! <br>Good luck everyone!

To everyone who&#39;s studying with this music:<br><br>Checklist: <br><br>• A bottle of water, at least 1 liter. Your brain works better if it has enough water and drinking helps you to concentrate💧<br><br><br><br>• Your charger. You sometimes don&#39;t even notice that your device&#39;s battery is going down, so better have it plugged in all the time🔋<br><br><br><br>• Your headphones. You will be able to focus more with headphones, because it blocks background noises. Also, if it&#39;s a late night study session, you won&#39;t wake up anyone🎧<br><br><br><br>• a tea or coffee. Coffee keeps you awake, green or black tea can make you feel more awake as well.☕<br><br><br><br>• Your study/work stuff:  your laptop/tablet/phone , a few pens, paper or whatever you need.⌨<br><br><br><br>•Anything else you could need, what about a heat pad, a blanket, a good lamp, your pet so you have a study buddy 🐈<br><br><br><br><br><br>Reminder : After an hour, you should stand up and walk a bit around. Better stop the music or put on different music for the break. Open your window, even if it&#39;s cold outside. Fresh air will make it better, trust me. <br><br>You could also lay your head down on your desk for ten minutes and listen to a podcast. Or, if you have to read a book, listen to the audiobook of it. You can also listen to the audiobook while doing another thing, that&#39;s even better than listening to music while reading the book.<br><br><br><br>I hope y&#39;all had a good day, if not, that&#39;s okay too. Remember to take care of yourself and try to get some sleep tonight 😴🧸<br><br><br><br>( This comment isn&#39;t originally mine but I want to help people )

Imagining myself in a Ghibli-created world reduces my stress level.

Don’t worry about your exam. Don’t worry about the homework due tomorrow. You’re doing amazing and even coming here to study is a start and I’m proud of you! You’re doing amazing. I believe in you &lt;3

Its crazy how with any other animation studio there tends to be one movie which stands above the others as the &quot;best&quot;. with ghibli, every movie is so special in its own way. they are all equally masterpieces.

This music is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise noise polluted work life. Thank you.

this is so nostalgic for me, it reminds me of being a little kid reading Tin-tin books. reading about how Tin-tin was raiding a pirate base, infiltrating Soviet Russia, exploring a jungle, fighting a resistance movement in Syldavia, or going to the moon. my Grandfather, who gave me these books, also played the piano so this really hits home. he passed away last year. &quot;The adventures of Nit-Nit&quot; he called it!

At this very moment, there is at least one person listening to this video or a Ghibli song. You are never alone 💜 I hope you find the peace and relief you seek. Thank you for existing. You are so loved. Keep going!!

Good songs. To everyone reading this: checklist: Always have water (1L), charger plugged in (at least one), take brakes (25/5 promodoro), be kind to yourself, remember to eat healthy, get enough sleep (7-9h), physical activity helps (at least 30min daily), cold shower helps, early sunlight in the morning (at least 10min), avoid blue light from screen at least 2 hours before bed. You can overcome your challenges!

the perfect mix to listen to on a sunny day to get you in the mood to be productive (especially with the first song). i can imagine being in a calm cafe listening to this and getting my work done.

I will be honest, I have listened to this track for more than 500 hours while I&#39;m doing my work, but I&#39;m still not tired of it.

I downloaded this 4 years ago and it&#39;s helped me fall asleep in so many places far away from home, and it&#39;s always worked, it&#39;s so special to me &lt;3

I&#39;m just so happy. Finally did it! I started my MA, now I&#39;m reading some texts for classes... Long way to go before getting a Ph.D., but I&#39;m glad I&#39;m already here. It wasn&#39;t easy to change country, I miss my family so much... but I&#39;ll see them soon, and make them proud. Let&#39;s do this

I work from home at an emergency call centre for a global travel company, and I&#39;ve been enjoying having this on repeat during my shift. It evokes such a calm ambiance to balance out working in a stressful environment.

hope everyone&#39;s study sessions are going good!!<br>don&#39;t forget to drink water <br>u got dis! :)

If you are struggling rn, remember that all of it is contributing to your personal growth. I hope you achieve every goal 🌱⭐️

Studio Ghibli is one of the greatest things to ever happen

to whoever&#39;s reading this now: you are already better than everyone else because you have immaculate taste. now go study or chill or whatever you need to do, i&#39;m rooting for you! :)

One day you&#39;ll look back on all your hard days of work, stress, anxiety and feel free. Remember you live this life for yourself, not anyone else. This song reminds me of nights I used to go out to celebrate getting through exams with friends, we would go to a local ramen bar, they had red lanterns and a lo-fi playlist always on. Stay Blessed &lt;3

Whenever I am stressed and my mind starts spiralling I come to one compilation of ghibli studio soundtracks. The comments and the music kinda teleport me into another universe where everything just seems better. Its always a break from reality. Everyone around is so kind and loving. It feels like home. My mind was against me again and as I heard the first tunes my lonelyness, frustration and worries got a little bit lighter on my shoulders. These places remind me that I am never truly alone. <br>To anyone who feels like the world is against them:<br>There is always someone out there who believes in you.<br>I do. <br>You are a great being and I am glad you exist. The world is a little bit better with you in it. You do great and I am proud of you for coming this far.<br>I wish you a great day/morning/night. Dont be so harsh to yourself. You deserve your own kindness. The child within you deserves it. I love you, stranger.

To whoever reads this<br>It is impossible to change your past, but you can surely design your future! <br>So, don’t worry about your past, just think about your future!!<br>I wish you success in your life! 😉 🔥🔥🔥

Feels good to make it through the long semesters. Enjoy the summer, stay strong everyone,and keep pushing for success.

I wish everyone who reads this commentary to always be happy, happy and have moments of relaxation to this wonderful music.

I wish for happy times, never had one. Maybe someday.

So lovely reading the comments on this video! I hope everyone has a wonderful day! Proud of everyone working so hard :)

If you come here because you need that little bit of peace, let me tell you please don&#39;t give up.<br> You have to keep fighting.<br> That stronger, faster, better you is waiting at the end of whatever battle you&#39;re fighting. <br>It&#39;s not the end.<br> It&#39;s only the beginning. <br>You have to get up<br>. Despite the numerous times you&#39;ve been slammed into the ground you have to dust yourself off and ask &quot;is that all you got?&quot; Because you&#39;re strong. <br>Know it. Own it. <br>Trust me, I know. <br>And if you have to go down, go down fighting with everything you&#39;ve got. Never stop fighting. <br>Please.<br> I&#39;m sure someday we will meet and show our battle scars and talk about how we made it. <br>Sleep easy tonight.<br> You need to rest. <br>Blessings and Love❤❤❤

Finishing my Masters&#39; thesis today! Good luck to everyone with your work 🤗

Right now, there is someone out there watching this video.  Believe me when I say that someone is there with you :-) I hope you are doing well, and that you are helped in whatever you need.  Thank you for being you.  You are truly loved, and a blessing.  Keep it up!!

This is the type of music that makes your heart feel so good it hurts.

To those who are reading this message, if you are having a hard time, remember that you are not alone and never give up. Wishing you health, success, love and happiness! ❤❤

Listening to this mix while writing an anthropology essay on the relation between everyday items and social class :)

When you grew up in the 90s and watch this as a kid and now your a grown-up and the music makes you realize how fast time has moved. Right now this music helps slow that time a little.

The fact that these notes in this particular pattern make hundreds of humans feel the same longing and nostalgia for something that doesn&#39;t exist....that&#39;s magic. That is what magic is.

A new school year means we&#39;re back and listening to every ghibli music compilation we can find👍

I&#39;m writing an essay at the moment, this music is the perfect blend of wordless beauty and liveliness to keep me awake without intruding on the task. Thank you.

Studio Ghibli will always hold a special place in my heart. The Music always makes me feel at home

this has made my study sessions 1000% more enjoyable and durable PLUS it¨s great to listen to when just taking a walk &lt;33

Enjoy your Friday everyone! Hopefully it will be a relaxing weekend 🌼

I will hear this and it will bring me back to these mornings preparing my lunch at 4am while listening to this being relaxed and getting ready for a day of construction. A memory of a chapter in my life. Thank you❤

Sounds like my childhood is escaping through my fingers as I grow older, but the nostalgia remain the same.

I don&#39;t know how you guys are capable of doing homework my mind is just racing at how awesome this music is

I was listening to an ambience track without music while studying when this playlist suddenly started on autoplay. It scared the wits out of me, but then I sat back and just listened. The first song felt so warm and happy, I couldn&#39;t help but cry. I feel like I&#39;ve been on autopilot for the past few weeks and you just woke me up. Thank you so much, I hope you have a good day!

I always cry whenever I hear mixes like this. It puts me in a place where everything is nothing... its an aspiration to reach that... so close, yet so out of reach...

Calmes the nerves while doing harsh chemotherapy for 5 days straight &lt;3

im in my garage doing renovation and blasting this on.<br>I am finishing the work now and enjoying home made ice coffee, chilling to this. <br> thank you for making my afternoon enjoyable and wonderful.

I just come here because I’m sad and this makes me feel less sad.

This is such a perfect playlist. I study with it, I cook with it, I leave it in the background while I read. 10/10 keep up the good work

This sort of music makes me feel calm and as if somewhere in this world there is a small place I can go where there is peace and the environment is not suffering. Where relaxation is the key to the happiness thats desired. Somewhere there are creatures that speak our language and the characters have dreams that are never too big, I would like to visit that lovely corner of the world that I only wished existed.

I usually choose a new lofi playlist each day, but since finding this one last week it&#39;s the only one I use! Perfect vibes, calm and gentle but positive and uplifting. Thank you so much Miyuki Studies!!!!

Some days are better, some days are worse. Look for the blessing instead of the curse. Be positive, stay strong, and get enough rest. You can’t do it all, but you can do your best

I just achieved peak happines listening to this

This was a wonderful listen, while I&#39;m doing stuff around the house before work. I may even put this up on my phone on my way to work! it&#39;s a foggy, wet day today.

This music is therapy. Ghibli is therapy.

loving the most healthy community ever &lt;3

This makes cleaning my room a whole lot more enjoyable. Damn I’m so lucky to have grown up with studio ghibli in my life

Using this while getting through a grindy part of verifying/updating personal information for all employees at work. This is giving me bliss.

This video is the only reason that I get things done.

WHAAAAAT?!?!  I don’t know how I stumbled on to this but I’m so glad I did!!!  This is perfect.  <br><br>Thank you for being born and making this.  &lt;3

i&#39;ve been preety stressed out and depressed the past few days, and this playlist has helped me through it quite alot<br>tysm &lt;3

I am so in love with Japan. My dream is to go there, visit the city but also the country side. I completely relax when I see photos or animes..for some reason my body just relaxes. God Bless Japan.

I found this in 2020, for some reason it already feels nostalgic

The lofi community understands me more than myself...

tysm for this playlist !! stumbled upon it while studying for my end years rly helped me concentrate :) forever gna be looping this for every single minor inconvenience i have Woo

This is my favorite instrumental playlist. I listen to it almost daily.

Incredible to study the most important exam of your life in 9 days

Miyuki,<br><br>the morning you played this track, while serving that special breakfast with the tastes I don&#39;t usually get..but that amazes me only all the time~ in last 3 years I played this track approximately billion times in Hong Kong and China, in Qazaqstan, in mountains, in steppes, by the sea, and along with the wind. I loved this track, I even got the mp3 copy of it on my computer and my phone, but...I never knew that the mix belongs to you.<br><br>At the hospital now, thinking of so much that is so little as happened to me these years. Decided to play my old favorite song, and found your name on it~<br><br>I&#39;m so happy.

studying for my math exam rn, this music is rll good aah<br>; good luck for everyone who’s studying too!!

This is the most beautiful music I have ever heard. This is really beautiful. Make me feel happy.

This was such a beautiful playlist. I played it on mellow volume on my speakers in my bedroom. I had the window open and there was a gentle breeze, the Sun shone through, its rays reflecting softly on my work desk. I had my notebook out to do some algebra revision, and I felt so relaxed. Thank you for this.

i like deep, gentle music like this. It makes me more comfortable and relaxed. Whenever i can&#39;t sleep, i turn on anime music without lyrics. It makes me forget stress and have goodnight&#39;s sleep

To any and all readers who need to hear this and can receive the next, i send you my love. Take sweet care, and whatever joy or calm you get from this message and music together may you marinade in it deeply.

to who ever reading this , may you have the strength to face any problem till the end

I&#39;ve been listening to a lot of peaceful music, and this is by far the most amazing piece. It instantly took my spirit flying over beautiful oceans and mountains. Thank you for creating this sheer peace itself !!

I have to do 250 flashcards by school time and I&#39;ve done 120. I am very stressed and its 2:45 AM. This playlist helps a lot! Thank you so much!

Anywhere you are, good luck on living your life and pursuing your target. Thank you for being kind and caring for your loved ones.

Well, this is the best jazz ghibli playlist I ever heard, sooooo jazzzy and still so dreamy Japanese.

This is HANDS DOWN the ONLY playlist that I can use to really fit the mood when me and my pet gerbal go ham

Спасибо замечательной студии Гибли и её создателю Хаяо Миядзаки за доброе и счастливое детство! Мне 21 год, я вырос на этих шедеврах! Эта музыка по хорошему заставляет вернуться в детство! Спасибо большое😃😭❤

I use this in the background while I work. It&#39;s very calming.

I put this on while I cook and eat..gives a lovely atmosphere to an otherwise lonely kitchen ❤

I don&#39;t know who needs to hear this but whatever is worrying you right now, forget about it. Take a deep breath, stay positive, and know that things will get better

I promise that I&#39;m gonna build an own animation studio inspired from studio ghibli. <br>I just want to create this magic storys and leave a memory for the viewers as studio ghibli did for all of us. <br>I have a long road ahead of me, but I can&#39;t stop smiling just thinking abotut this childhood dream of mine.<br>Whatever you wanna accomplish in your life.. - enjoy the process, you&#39;re already there, time just didn&#39;t catch up yet. &lt;3

Doing my first homework for my first year in College.

This is so pretty. I&#39;ve been listening to this for days now. Perfect for focused work on a week where I&#39;m one of a few people working. Thank you so much for this.

This music is perfect for the mornings I have wake up at 5 make coffee by 6 and have coffee at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZals4U6Z_I&amp;t=390">6:30</a> and enjoy the fresh air

My kid loves to listen to this every time they need to do there Japanese homework! Thankyou!

I&#39;m making bamboo flutes in the caribbeans. And listenning to this while working makes me feel like craftsmen and women in the Ghibli&#39;s 😍

This music got me through the last stress on my final written exam tonight. Cracked open a nice cold beer and I am currently enjoying the relief and the night. I can feel the summer coming.<br>s

This tracks gave me hope to keep on living. Thank you for spending your time for creating this awesome playlist. You&#39;re literally saving lives rn

this is one of my favorite playlists. : ) &lt;3 Ghibli

Listen to this all day. Absolutley beautiful.

I love jazz for relaxing and making art.

lovely ! i very much enjoyed this playlist : )

I love listening to this when I&#39;m playing chill farming games, where the music gets repetitive. This fits the theme of the games so well...

This music is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise noise polluted work life

this saved my procrastinating self!

This is really great. I love it&#39;s upbeat take on the classic themes. It makes a feeling of, &quot;Everything is gonna be okay...&quot; come up. Take a deep breath and enjoy the music for just a moment.

really needed this music to get through AP studying. good luck to everyone no matter what you&#39;re doing rn! &lt;3

I&#39;m sitting here on the back patio, with a light summer rain; this on softly in the background... just a tad below the level of the orchard crickets... Belleissimo!!! Thank You for making/putting this up!

Miss you Jamie, thanks for showing me these movies.

This music is amazing for work, study or just enjoy life! thanks!!!

feel like spending my mornings in a coffee shop with this as the soundtrack and a good book☕

I always listen to this while studying. My favorite ones are &#39;Carrying You&#39; and &#39;A Town With An Ocean View&#39;

So many negative comments in the world, every video you look at is debate and disdain, but here is just... peaceful. Happiness. Wellness. Simpleness. Thanks for that everybody

so nice to study and chill a bit to. Hope everyone&#39;s having a lovely day! :))

To all people who are facing difficulties in their current situation, I want to say, it&#39;s alright... We will all go over this and better days are coming! Sending Virtual Hugs to you~ Hang on for now!

I listen to this as I work on my projects in the garage. Helps to calm me down and focus my mind on the project at hand. 10/10

in my opinion the best ghibli-playlist:D

My girlfriend and I were listening to this playlist together (I Really wanted her to hear it haha) and my head was in her lap and she was playing with my hair. It was bliss, really. She kinda looked down at me and went &quot;The title is always how I feel about you.&quot; and so, I laughed and she went &quot;See? My heart just exploded.&quot; and it was so cheesy I cried. I thought some people may enjoy that little bit.

definitely makes some great background music while working.  Thanks for this!

nobody knows me but I wna share today&#39;s goals while listening to this jazz:<br>-4 mins script writing<br>-memorise the speech<br>-draft for the 800 words essay!!

to anyone who&#39;s reading this, no matter where you go, you will always be here, but remember there is always someone out there who will always love you. Look up at the moon &lt;3

Gorgeous, your space designs are amazing, I love them. My type of setting is peaceful and not hot, simply relaxing, taking in the cozy jazz atmosphere of autumn.

To whoever it may concern I hope all your tiredness, doubt, and stress washes away and be replace with calm and love 🥰

this playlist  is not just a playlist

I don&#39;t know what is it about these, water landing planes. But they are perfect in this image. Makes me wonder where they land. Just the sight of them flying over this beautiful sight.

Stop reading the comments immediately to let your eyes rest and listen to the rain sounds with your ears to relax and start sleeping!

God bless you all, may He be with you all in your studies!

This music just hits, feels like home

There&#39;s always a hint of magic in Studio Ghibli films.

Anyone with exams coming up I wish you all the best 😘 you will smash it!

This helped me stay calm and relax while working!! To think my mind is all over the place and want to juggle everything at once!!!

This would be a perfect song to listen to as you drive through Paris or an open field

i have adhd and when i do art shit i can never focus properly and end up sidetracked into other stuff and my art never gets finished and a lot of details look off and stuff but with this i actualy focus and make it look pretty. its so nice and vibey

This is absolutely delightful. Many thanks for this masterpiece !

This was such a lovely find. Thank you for uploading this 🙏🏼

Spread kindness every opportunity you can ❤

just got off work, off the next 2 days, making a late night meal to this.💨😌

This playlist is amazinngggg! I do my homework, chores, makeup, and other tasks while listening to this video. It calms me down and has a nostalgic feel.

I&#39;m playing lol with this calm music and it&#39;s make me feel cool and chill for entire game pressure and i start to in more and more with it, great work TY.

I really love the  jazz arrangements. BCG total genius!

This made my day. After a long challenging day these are just the relaxing nostalgic sounds I needed to wind down. Thanks for another masterpiece, 💚💚💚💚💚💚

When i started listen to non-vocals musics I couldn&#39;t stop. This is my type of music, the fact that there is no lyrics allow me to interpret and imagine so much more stories

i am studying for my theory test and this is just so good to listen to while I focus!

These kinds of picture makes me very nostalgic of the 90s cartoons, something to it

my local teriyaki place plays this mix whenever i&#39;m in there and i love it

Great mix!❤️

If you’re studying and want your baby to go down for a nap OR just want your baby to go down for a nap so you can too. This is the one. Love it.

Love it! This music made my day! It&#39;s so  good to listen while doing my thesis haha, it&#39;s fun and not sad, it&#39;s calm but happy, love it!

I just finished one of the final assessments during this play :D

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZals4U6Z_I&amp;t=1506">25:06</a> for all my Howl&#39;s Moving Castle fans out there!!!!

the comments made me cry, they are so supportive and I have an ultra scary exam tomorrow  😭 😭 😭 😭

All the positive comments below this video made me cry a bit. We all have hard times. Keep pulling through, you are not alone in this. <br>And if you don&#39;t have a hard time, keep it up, youre doing great &lt;3

Such lovely music, listening to this while studying, but I&#39;ll also probably listen to it to relax later

I really loved your mix, you can really hear the ghibli themed music, but with a nice jazz feeling &lt;3

This music just keeps giving me an idea while animating. Thank you so much!

Thank you for this mix! It gives me pleasure! It&#39;s charming!

Not studying or anything while listening to this.<br>I&#39;m in my car, it&#39;s midnight and I&#39;m on my 15. Life couldn&#39;t get any better.

Hey you, yeah you. The one reading this. Wanna know a secret? You’re unique and beautiful. Don’t ever forget this.

listening while playing axie relieves the stress it gives

This is really helping me get through my dissertation, thank you! Excellent vibes

이 지브리 갬성.. 너무 좋슴다 ㅠ 언젠가 사진 속의 저곳에 가서 아무 걱정 없이 하늘을 바라보고 누워 있고 싶네요.. 지친 일상 속에서 힐링이 되는 좋은 플리 넘 감사합니다

Let&#39;s all fly together....but beautiful

Thats the most suitable thing to listen ever <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/hf90Xv-jHeOR8gSxxrToBA"></a>

hey if you&#39;re reading this i just want to remind you how loved and special and valid and worthy you are!! you are truly amazing and i hope you aknowledge that. it&#39;s okay to feel sad and to feel &quot;negative&quot; emotions; we&#39;re humans after all. if you&#39;re feeling down remember to take good care of you and to do something that makes you feel at peace. you&#39;re gonna be okay, i promise you &lt;3

I put this on my speaker for my sister while she did school; it was perfect!  Thanks a bunch! ❤️

This has actually helped me alot thanks! :D

Happy 35 years of Ghibli &lt;3

I&#39;m deep into my post grad job searching and it&#39;s stressing me out beyond belief.  Luckily this is helping me feel so much lighter.  Good luck to everyone with whatever you&#39;re trying to achieve :)

Currently developing application for my final year project, wish me luck guys &lt;3

I always pull up to a lofi comment section when I need some support and tbh y&#39;all are pulling throughhh so here&#39;s a checklist for anyone doing the same:<br>- HYDRATION (doesn&#39;t have to be water, grab a soda or a juice or a tea :3)<br>- Check in with your body for a sec and make sure you&#39;re comfortable. Sometimes we don&#39;t notice that itchy sweater or uncomfy posture, but once it&#39;s gone you&#39;ll feel sooo much better.<br>- Don&#39;t forget to take breaks from working (or stressing). Just chilling and listening to the music can be a refresher.<br>- Romanticize everything!! Anything can be aesthetic if you put your mind to it. Especially with some music on.<br>- Tell a friend you love them - I can attest, they need it just as much as you do.<br><br>Ily. For your first time being alive you&#39;re doing a pretty great job of it. So don&#39;t give up!!<br>- ⛦

this music is so beatiful and relaxing!

Best time to turn your dreams in reality was yesterday and the second best time is now, better start now because now will be yesterday very soon💝

Very nice Bro. U damn got it. I feel this jazzy glammy music. 👍🏻 Imagin you were in a coffeeshop while hearing this!

currently working on an SQL project and enjoying this. best of luck to all of us♡.

C&#39;est tellement relaxant, et ça endort !!<br>Super idée les musiques Ghibli avec un style jazz ! J&#39;adore❤️

Simultaneously studying for my license exam and a related training class for work. These are perfect background tunes👌

Doing my psychology final rn, wish me luck 🥲💕

Studio Ghibli is Love ❤️

Love this! Thanks a lot! So many beautiful memories from the movies!

I will be honest, I have listened to this track for more than 500 hours while I&#39;m doing my work, but I&#39;m still not tired of it.

I love how everyone is just high and chilling it feels like we’re all friends and we don’t even know eachother

This is such a perfect playlist. I study with it, I cook with it, I leave it in the background while I read. 10/10 keep up the good work

Its crazy how with any other animation studio there tends to be one movie which stands above the others as the &quot;best&quot;. with ghibli, every movie is so special in its own way. they are all equally masterpieces.

This music is a breath of fresh air in an otherwise noise polluted work life. Thank you.

I usually choose a new lofi playlist each day, but since finding this one last week it&#39;s the only one I use! Perfect vibes, calm and gentle but positive and uplifting. Thank you so much Miyuki Studies!!!!

Started listening to this to focus on work, but it&#39;s too good, now I can&#39;t focus

This makes me want to do better with myself and I hope one day I can give you guys the same energy. Much love!

So cool! Love studio ghibli lofi!!!<br><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/m8MfY4jbFsWJhL0PyouA2Ak"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/m8MfY4jbFsWJhL0PyouA2Ak"></a><a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/m8MfY4jbFsWJhL0PyouA2Ak"></a>

this playlist is such great company when you&#39;re on your own &lt;3

Ando bien estresado porque tengo muchos exámenes por calificar y nomás no le veo fin, esta playlis me está ayudando a llevarlo mejor. Éxito a todos.

Finals week and then summer :) Good luck everyone

Feels like going back to my child hood and see the things I missed

This music is amazing!!<br>I&#39;ve just started researching for an essay, and this music helps keep me calm while my mind buzzes away.<br>Thank you Kiyuki Studies. <br>:):)

Acabei de descobrir que amo esse tipo de música, principalmente para estudar! Obrigada a todos os envolvidos, todas essas músicas despertaram um ótimo sentimento em mim, de verdade!<br>E a todos os estudantes, fé! Você é forte e conseguirá atingir seus objetivos, um abraço. Jesus ama você!

I love how are so many people whit positive coments in so many videos like this.

I wonder how people study listing music.. I can&#39;t even do my homework listing music. Complete concentration is indeed required specially for the guy like me.🌱

Using this to work from home :) thanks! best of luck to everyone here with their studying

Sounds so relaxing ❤️

This is very smothering. After a week of hard work, Listening to this on Saturday morning is a feeling of relaxation. Thank you creator for creating this &amp; uploading for everyone. god bless.

I got to see Joe Hisaishi conduct a live symphony a few days ago, I feel so honored to have experienced it.

This video single-handedly helped me get through my senior year of university. Thank you sm❤️❤️

This is delicious. Helps me concentrate while translating❤🧉

feels good to be done with school. Just proof-reading a paper for a friend. Goodluck everyone!

Love Porcorosso. One of the best feel good animated films of all time.

How is it that after all this time iv&#39;e JUST learned that studio Ghibli jazz is a thing?!?!?

모두들 힘내시고 목표 이루시는 한해 되세요!! 😊😊

the start-song is perfect

Ahhh this is so nice. I love these covers.

this is the best thing i&#39;ve came across this year 🥲

Played this on a speaker at Laramie with my band class for a trip. It was a good trip

Good luck everybody with your work, homework, essays and exams ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

Have a nice day

Working on a video game while listening to this~

Some awesome music, for my pet store. : )

You’ve got this! Relax😊

listening to this in class while doing some work is pretty nice if you ask me. Thanks for this :)

Because the comment section needs it, here there are the more or less accurate time code, with the french title of the movie (because of my french dumbass). I didn’t reconize all the titles, even if some themes sound familiar.

may all your dreams come true

I want a ghibli themed cafe 😭😭💖

Some real life cafes play this set list, and I applaud them for doing so.

what a chill relaxing music!

Have graduated for 2+ years now and technically don&#39;t need to study academically anymore, but this playlist makes me want to crack open the books again.

This video has legitmately gotten me though 4 years of college

Y&#39;all listening to this while doing school and I&#39;m over here vibing with my fanfic 😎

Agora me resta apenas mais um trabalho final! Boa sorte a todos que estão em situações parecidas.

this is so relaxing.

I listen to this while I play Run 3. Love The Vibe

POV: your AirPods die so you’re listening to this without them in your office and literally everyone wants to know who’s on hold

Wished this was on spotify :((

It seems unimaginable difficult to grasp why and how music can provoke such strong emotions or with such precision convey a specific message. Yet, it is impossible not to appreciate it.

Exciting adventures and delightful surprises ahead!

it sounded very much like &quot;Happen - Heize&quot;

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZals4U6Z_I&amp;t=6648">1:50:48</a> POG TIMESTAMP

amazing study music or bgm for nearly anything, gem of a video

This is so relaxing!

is there a spotify version? Would love to add it to my playlist

Que vibe boa

This is perfect, so pleasant to listen while studying.

wonderful! hope everyone is having a great day!!

Amei💖🇧🇷

Very nice! Love this! Is possible to have a complete tracklist with timestamps? Thanks! Hugs from Italy! :)

coding away...and this playlist is perfect....

You are special, do not give up because you have a lot of things to live.... I hope you get better :)

Thanks for inspiring me. Nice tunes and animations 😊 Stay positive

I was riding my bike after questionable gas station food, and I pooped myself while this music was playing. Honestly aside from the smell, it&#39;s not even that bad

in a world where studying seems &#39;old-school&#39;, I hope those who are studying hard for exams will someday rule the world.

20mins to my interview and listening to this to calm my nerves and anxious mind. to whoever&#39;s reading this, just wanna say you got this! All will be well :) sending positive vibes

It&#39;s good on a winter evening too

The first one gave me Club Penguin&#39;s Pizza Parlor vibes tho ... why ....

Much love. Great job. Have a 👍

와 재즈 느낌 너무 잘산다ㅜㅠㅠ 너무 듣기 좋음..

Just seeing Porco Rosso&#39;s plane makes me happy... 👍😄💖👋

What is the name of the first song? I really like it.<br><br>Edit: Nevermind, I got it. It&#39;s a song from Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service.

매우 편안한 음악

This is beautiful! subscribed after just one video love the picture too!

今もどこかで眠れない人がこの音楽を聞いているのかと思うと胸の辺りがぎゅーってなる。

Please someone explain to me all of the nonsense bot comments that follow the exact same format? I feel like I&#39;m missing something big here. Big love to the music. My dissertation draws nearer to being finished with each fresh, crisp spring morning note.

No matter where you are in life, always remember that bungee gum possesses the properties of both rubber and gum.

This really is calm to listen too even if its just to help study. Especially since im turning 18 and starting college in august ^^ wish me luck guys<br>I hope to come back after i finish

I hope everyone here is doing well and if not, better times lie ahead 🙏🏻❤

In the past I&#39;ve too made the joke, &quot;White people trying to do anything without lo-fi music...&quot; yet here I am, fulfilling the prophecy

What is it whit all these weird comments that just sound like random words and are less than a day old?

this randomly played while im studying, and the bg image is related to my studies lol got sprinkled some inspiration, thank u.

this is incredible. there is even a little of bossa nova

I&#39;m deaf, I just come here to look at the pictures.

The loose payment randomly learn because save historically train versus a grandiose division. tranquil, truthful verse

Everybody listens to this playlist to help them concentrate in their studies. While I put it on speaker and listen when I&#39;m cleaning, it helps me focus and enjoy doing chores more.    ♡~

I love the work, keep it up!!

why does the first song sound like the Soviet anthem??

Writing an ecological statement for a development site, 14.5k words and nearly half way through, it was due with the government planning agency two weeks ago. It needs to be submitted tomorrow or I get sued. Good luck everyone, it could be worse!

Calm, relaxing, perfect!

this is PERFECT

The momentous plywood phenotypically repeat because forest culturally interrupt aside a electric spaghetti. chivalrous, simplistic sousaphone

This is just perfect.

Keep your heads up guys :Eventually it’ll be alright 🎉

everyone using this for work but its a rainy morning where i am and it&#39;s perfect :-)

Very good music

Always listening to this when exam is about to come😌

excellent mix!!

this is a banger for when i&#39;m doing my homemwork
