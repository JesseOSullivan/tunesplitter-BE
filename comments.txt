This soundtrack, it makes me homesick for a place I&#39;ve never been

Wish I could experience this anime like it was the first time again

Anime world: ‚Äúoh no we‚Äôre stuck in sao we are gonna die!!!‚Äù<br><br>Us in the real world: ‚Äú I wished we were in sao üò£üò´‚Äù

Hate it or love it, you can&#39;t deny that Sword Art Online has some of the best soundtracks

i miss the days when i watched this show, i was younger, i would sit on the couch during the summer, breez blowing through the trees and into my hair through an open window. i would sit, watch, and wonder when i would meet someone like Asuna in the real world.

Two things we can all agree on about this anime :<br><br>1. Excellent Voice Acting.<br>2.Excellent Soundtrack.

803 disslike:<br>Laughing coffin members

1.5 more years until Nerve Gear&#39;s release in the anime, let&#39;s pray

I love how Kirito was fighting mainly for Asuna and how Asuna was fighting for Kirito

why do we close our eyes when we pray, cry, kiss, or dream? because the most beautiful things in life are not seen but felt by the heart.

Who still 2020 Pandemic Covid-19<br>Still S.A.O forever

i am trying to study with this music, but i can&#39;t concentrate because I am having too many memories

I dont care what people say sao will forever be one of my favorite animes

Looking through all the comments, I&#39;m glad there are people out there who appreciate this. I was very little when I first watched SAO, it was recommended to me by a friend. Within the first few minutes of the first episode, I knew I loved the show. I didn&#39;t know I would become a huge anime fan after that. I&#39;m older now and sometimes find myself referencing shows or copying what they do. It&#39;s kind of like, without doing that I wouldn&#39;t be who I am. I&#39;ve come very far in life. I went from being that little kid that watched shows in my spare time to a young adult who works their hardest. What I&#39;m trying to say is: I&#39;m glad that people are still watching SAO. I know it definitely helped me grow as a person and I hope it does the same for others as well.

It just hurts when such a masterpiece I&#39;ve been listening to for a year has been copyrighted. It&#39;s so sad we have to accept it and can&#39;t do anything about it! :((

I felt so confused when i clicked on this video and it was a different song. I understand their copyright concerns, but please look further and beyond! This was the BEST SAO ost video on youtube. They rather have no one listening to their music and implement their copyright than having people listening to this wonderful ost.

What makes sao so great isnt just the animation, plot, and characters... but the fact it emotionally hits more than any other show/anime  I&#39;ve seen. The people that hate sao have to find logic in everything done in it, and there&#39;s not problem with that... but if you come to the show only thinking about how the show has no logic to it, you came for the wrong purpose. Sao teaches lessons to people especially within  the teenage age group, and isnt meant to be heavily thought about because that ruins the purpose. When it comes to SAO you think less and just watch more, because every episode has something important to teach.

Essentially for anyone whose wondering what&#39;s happening. Sony JP have had a small crack down on copyrighted content. When this happens and a video is striked or claimed  the content creator is given the choice to amend the claim by muting copyrighted segments or replacing them with music from YouTube&#39;s royalty free library. That&#39;s what&#39;s happened here. It sucks but it is what it is.

For anyone wondering what happened to the original SAO soundtrack for this video. Basically the creator had to change it due to copyright issues or something among those lines. It was either that or take the video down. Cooperate issues once again ruining people‚Äôs joy. Yayyyüòë

It&#39;s amazing how when watching the anime you don&#39;t pay attention to the music, but when you listen to it here, it sounds so strangely similar. Love this!

There&#39;s a reason SAO has always been my favorite anime. Sometimes the story elements get a little silly, but I love the characters, the world, the action, and the music.  The part where people died aside, SAO is a kind of world that I would love to live in.

It‚Äôs sad that a lot of the OSTs for this channel aren‚Äôt here anymore. They should honestly say something in the title or description instead of having me excited to listen to some calm SAO OST and I get this

SAO is just so precious to me. It taught me that in situations where we and our friends or family are in soo pain , it is our responsibility to act and motivate them through pep talks, our relationships are the things that we should care about the most. And there will always be people who are like bad mouthing everyone whom they don&#39;t like, but we should just ignore them and be confident in our strength , they&#39;re is a quote -<br><br>&#39;Try not to take things personally, what people say about you is a reflection of them, not you.&#39;<br><br>I know its a normal quote but if you go deep into it you will get soo motivated ‚ô°

2020? SAO forever!!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>SAO Alicization War of Underworld second part coming this april! Cant wait for it man

When I listen to this I close my eyes and wish I could leave this world and go to that one.

I&#39;m reposting this comment a second time for anyone who has missed it. Essentially for anyone whose wondering what&#39;s happening. Sony JP have had a small crack down on copyrighted content. When this happens and a video is striked or claimed  the content creator is given the choice to amend the claim by muting copyrighted segments or replacing them with music from YouTube&#39;s royalty free library. That&#39;s what&#39;s happened here. It sucks but it is what it is.

the part where he comes back to reality and has to study for his future hits hard

I would give up everything to live in a world like SAO, even with the death part.

THIS <br>IS <br>THE<br>MOST<br>PERFECT<br>ANIME<br>I<br>HAVE<br>EVER<br>WATCHED<br><br><br>SAO ALWAYS #1

I&#39;ve loved this soundtrack ever since freshman year of high school and it&#39;s helped me through a lot... SAO was one of the first animes I watched too and it&#39;s defiantly one of my favorites :) Thank you so much The Soul of Wind for the wonderful memories and this beautiful compilation ~ ‚ô•

I have bad gastritis pains from time to time. And when the pains kick in. I immediately put this video on and when I do. The music relaxes me and eases the pain away. And it helps me get the necessary sleep I‚Äôve been losing. Thank you so much for posting this up. It really helps me out physically, mentally, and emotionally.

People ask me why I am so addicted to videogame&#39;s and I simply reply with, &quot;I&#39;m not addicted to videogame but rather addicted to being able to escape this boring and normal life we all live into one with story&#39;s and adventure, as Kirito once said, &quot;even thought it&#39;s a virtual world, I feel more alive in this world then I ever did in the real world.&quot; In videogames, you can be anyone, do anything, a single blade can take you anywhere you want to go...videogame are not just a time killer for me but rather a whole different world of adventure...

I know many people have said this and you probably won&#39;t read it, but this music truly gives me serenity. Thank you for posting it.

I use to really talk down on anime. And then I watched sao and now I can‚Äôt even hear the music w out feeling homesick basically for another world.

This show makes me wanna play a MMORPG that is just like SAO :(

You can say whatever you want about the show, but goddamn does SAO have a great soundtrack.

Feel Good

well i just hope one day i meet nice and kind persone as asuna,never been so much for love but after this it just change my whole view of evrything so i thank u SAO willl always remamber u even when i get old

Is it just me or I would love to be trapped in sao too

The people who think SAO was stupid can just go away. In my experience it was the best anime I have watched so far and I am definitely hopping for a season 3 :D

Sword Art Online meant the world to me, and still does of course. The first season was just amazing back then, and the first 14 episodes (Aincrad Arc) were so special to me. Joy, sadness, feelings I still have of SAO. These songs will always remind me of the one thing I truly wish in this life: &quot;Link Start!&quot;

I may never be able to watch this show for the first time again,<br> but I will never give up on it,<br>and I will never forget what it has taught me.

<b>Me and my GF after watching Titanic</b><br>GF: omg, that movie was so sad, how did you not cry once? Do you have no emotion?<br><br><br>Me: <b>has flashbacks of watching SAO</b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Also me: <b>breaks out in tears</b>

I didn&#39;t cry. <br><br>I remembered.<br>I feeled.<br>I feeled how my heart melted.<br>I dreamed it. <br>I love...<br><br><br><br><br>Sao.

rewatched after 5 years and still the best anime i‚Äòve ever seen.. and the music is just perfect, thank you for this mixüòç

Listening to this is just reminding me how peaceful life can be, and it only took a global pandemic and riots for me to realize that. But in the end, just like in every fairytale stories, it&#39;s all worth it.

The very first track makes me feel extremely nostalgic at seemingly everything somehow...

This makes me feel so nostalgic. Back then I never would have imagined that I&#39;d be a major anime fan. But then I found a cool SAO bag and bought it, I figured why not watch the anime behind it? So I did and I&#39;m glad I did. SAO was so beautiful, the characters all have great backstories, the battles are awesome, the art is well-made, and the music is so heartwarming and it makes you feel all sorts of emotions. The voice actors and creators, everyone who contributed to this anime all did well, I thank them all for giving me this amazing experience.

Its amazing that the creator of Sword Art Online made the characters&#39; backstories so detailed and real that you know what made them the person they are. All of the experiences these people have been through make them selfless and caring like asuna and kirito. Loyal like Klein and brave like agil. All of these people have been through a lot like surviving the death game Sword Art Online and later on kirito in SAOII gun gale online, where he saves sinon from getting murdered irl. These people fight for strangers, their friends and for each other so that one day there will be peace for them and others.

my hope is still on my heart that hopefully one-day vrmmo will actually come true

Imagine if SAO could be a never ending story... I would watch EVERYTHING untill i&#39;m not dead. But everything thats beautiful allways have to end.  :(

kirito and asuna make me cry. I love them so much

Who else is hyped after SAO progressive was announced?

Oh my heart just exploded. I love this anim√©! I remember way back in my teenage years. This anim√© was a huge part of my life. Waiting for every episode every week. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

When u realise Klein was born in 2000 so he&#39;s the same age as you.

Me: I fear no man, but that thing, <br><b>The realization that I may never be able to reach that castle in the sky</b><br>It scares me.

Who knew the sao soundtrack would be so relaxing. I&#39;m doing my homework rn and I feel so much more relaxed. It&#39;s funny how a show that&#39;s kinda dark is so sweet at the same time

Youtube: how many ads would you like<br>The Soul of Wind: yes

SAO has the best sound track I have ever heard. And The song &quot;at our parting&quot; just rips your heart out, that song was used when Aincrad was falling and kirito thought he was losing Asuna forever. From the begining all the way to the new Sao aliciazation every single song and episode has been amazing. So thankful my nephew showed me this series and I can hold this love story close to my heart.

After watching the full season like 6 times, I never get tired of it. Any still watching this anime in 2017?

Always had people hating on SAO, but to me, this is one of the best anime out there, accompanied by some of the best soundtracks.

I hope we all live to see the day when a nervegear VR headset is released, and we can actually visit Aincrad.

Me: Okay lets see how long I can go without crying...<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=2">0:02</a> in...<br>Me: Okay I&#39;ve lost

For me , SAO is the best anime i have ever watched ... I&#39;m a big fan of it and i really love those scenes with kirito , asuna and yui being together and fighting for their future ... this anime got my feels and im so hyped for Season 3 but i hope kirito and asuna will be more together again . Best part of this anime are those first 14 episodes in real SAO and the music is great .

This was the best SAO OST video out there... Been listening to it for years and it always brought back a sense of nostalgia. I can&#39;t believe they copyrighted the video, this just isn&#39;t right... They don&#39;t want people listening to their music? I understand the legalities behind things but DAMN it hurts

I don&#39;t care what anyone says, SAO will always have a special place in my heart for bringing me back to anime

I still remember being 11 years old and sitting down and watching sao, sao taught me many stuff that I thought I would never learn.

How to ruin my mood<br>1. Listen to this song while I was trying to sleep<br>2. Ads appears in the middle of the video

This is the video that i was looking for!!! thank you so much!!

When the first &quot;SAO style&quot; vrmmo comes out can the creator/developer enroll everyone, willing of course, in this comment section before the rest?! Like 2020 sucks over here.

this gives me so much nostalgia, one of my first animes i‚Äôve watched. i remember just binging this show on a cool summer night. honestly i really don‚Äôt understand why so many people hate this, it shouldn‚Äôt be a trend. this makes me wish that this game was actually real, escaping reality then going to a peaceful world and having joy every moment.seeing the beautiful nature in that place damn. thank you sao, you‚Äôve made my childhood worth.

Kirito ‚ô• Asuna   ‚ô°FOREVER‚ô°

Listening to this while I&#39;m doing school work and I do not regret it. It is such a peaceful listen that I could also fall asleep to it not gonna lie.

I wish everyone could hear this... even if they haven&#39;t watched the anime. This soundtrack is just so relaxing and emotional. It&#39;s just amazing... üíï

I wish SAO was real * thanks for the likes*

I love this so much ! Thank you !!! Anyone watch<br> Sword art online ????

normal people: <b>puts on all i want for Christmas is you</b><br><br>me:

Broo why the music changed. I like the old soundtrack

I wish I could flee to that beautiful world without worries

Who&#39;s here in 2019? This playlist just brings forward all the feelings I had of the virtual world. I may have started off by playing minecraft, and not something along the lines of Sword Art Online, but I can feel everything I felt when I first jumped in to the virtual world. The wonder of how it all worked. The tears that were shed when I had finally made friends. The love I felt for everything in that world. This playlist, it just sums it all up. I could go on talking about this forever, but Sword Art Online is a fantastic anime. I don&#39;t care what the world thinks. Bitch about the main character or plot holes, fine. However, don&#39;t you dare shit on the narratives that were presented in this story. Don&#39;t you dare tear apart the emotions it brought forward in the hearts of every viewer. This series has had such an impact on my life. In fact, it&#39;s the reason I&#39;ll be pursuing game design in college next year. People like us, we all need a world like Sword Art Online. A place where we can all be heroes. A place where we can all be free.

I remember watching this show when I was 11 during the summer without a care for the world, just chilling with no work. Listening to this music makes me wanna go back to when I was younger.

This soundtracks are enough to make a grown man cry

If the SAO game was real,it would be like a beautiful dream that you never want to end.<br>And games like this are a way to escape your real life and become whatever you want in this world

what‚Äôs good

Love this, makes me feel really sleepy! Also helps with anxiety! Thanks a tone! :)

This show and music brings out soooo many emotions for me ü•¥ Makes me feel something with every moment. One of my favorite stories for sure, and I‚Äôll always stand by it for being my absolute favorite anime

I found a very special person in my life when I first started SAO. It was also the first anime I watched. I was overcome with happiness, sadness and other emotions while watching this show. And sense I found a very special person in my life while watching this show, it only amplified my emotions indefinitely. I could also relate to Kirito. Thx you Nightlight for being my Asuna. : )<br><br>Edit: And you still are my Asuna Nightlight, never forget it and I‚Äôm here for you.‚ÄîI will always be with you. I will give everything I have.‚Äî

Everytime listen S.A.O music. I always goosebumps :)

<b>this music makes comments more emotional than they should be</b>

the song really have a special  place inside me, recognizing every piece of notes and start to see this memories, what a wonderful music.

I&#39;m in 2020 quarantine and this just brightens up my day ü•∞

<b>I know it&#39;s impossible but I wish SAO had infinite seasons. Their music is just beautiful and gives you a sense of nostalgia (well, all anime songs do) but still.</b>

Idc what y&#39;all say about SAO, I really enjoyed the series and the soundtrack.

It is listening to the first melody and automatically remembering the first time I saw Sao. What a good story, what magnificent characters, and what a great soundtrack.

One day my fellow internet dwellers, we too, can experience such a world, as Sword Art Online.

I miss you Sword Art Online!!~~ :&#39;(

Bro these background music, it gives me the feels. I‚Äôve watched SAO like 9 times and man it just feels so nostalgic.

I could have sworn this video used to have the actual music from SAO...  Maybe I&#39;m trippin.  Maybe both?  Still beautiful music though!

Seems like I&#39;m gonna rewatch it. See you in 2 Days!

the first song is just the best i have tears üò≠

Whenever I watch the show again it just gives me the same chills and happiness every time, SAO is the best anime ever created!

Video: &quot;starts&quot;<br>My brain: <br>My heart:<br>Me:<br>My memories: &quot;let&#39;s be happy and nostalgic at the same time.&quot;<br>Me: &quot;but your fa..k...e&quot;<br>My brain &amp; heart: &quot;shut up and listen!&quot;

‰∫∫Áîü„ÅßÂàù„ÇÅ„Å¶Ê≥£„ÅÑ„Åü„Ç¢„Éã„É°„ÅåSAO „Åß„Åó„Åü„ÄÇ<br>ÊúÄÈ´ò„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<br>ÊäïÁ®øËÄÖ„Åï„Çì„ÄÅÊú¨ÂΩì„Å´„ÅÇ„Çä„Åå„Å®„ÅÜüòÉ

omfg this bring back memories.. I almost cry at the first soundtrack..

i remember those times just by listening to the music and it made me so homesicküò¢<br>SAO IS THE BEST

I&#39;ll never forget those first moments when watching SAO. The moments Kirito spent together with Asuna, and the happiness they shared together as a couple. The moments when going to sleep I&#39;d always try and predict what happens next, and then the next day I&#39;d be happy to just be watching it. I don&#39;t know why people told me they stopped halfway through Season 2, I was determined to finish the series no matter what. Every episode I watched I wasn&#39;t disappointed, but even happier ready for the next. I just wanted to say listening deeply to this music made me remember those heartfelt moments in the anime, and the times I&#39;d never forget although they&#39;re just fantasy. So, thank you SAO Team for everything!

Who was here in 2018 ?<br><br>update : I came across my comment 3 years later and I still listen to this playlist which is magical

just watched Sao season 1 &amp; 2.... I can&#39;t help but feel a little depressed since it&#39;s over for now, I smile so much watching this show xD

can we all just take a moment and appreciate how much this anime has done for us, wish all 5k comments could meet up in the world

You&#39;ve just earned another subscriber!

The first one just drilled my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è I take SAO very seriously. TOO seriously. it was everything to me. Until dreadful episode 14, when they made it out. I liked SAO, sword art online, original death game best. This music brings back so many good memories. I feel like I lived there myself and my HP reached zero. Every month or so, i go back and watch it again. i remember the first time I watched episode 14 I cried so hard my parents got worried. (When asuna died. And even more when kirito did!) I feel like when I saw that episode, even if I could go watch SAO again, it was just ruined. They made it out. It was it. All over. Just memories recorded on tape. If you watch it again, you can&#39;t live it again I felt like I lived it the first time. Now its over. I still love it, but please, someone bring back the SAO I lived.

Not the &quot;best&quot; Anime but I definitely can relate all of your feelings. Watched it in 2014 for the first time (also first anime I&#39;ve ever watched till the end). Then again in 2016 when season 2 released. Now, in 2019, Season 1 showed up in my Netflix List. All them feelings come back. I have goosebumps in most of the scenes. So many feelings. That&#39;s just crazy. Love the anime

Every time I watch SAO, which has been around 4 times so far, every few years, I always cry at the end. It is so sweet, the journey of fighting for what you believe in and saving others. The stories of friendship hit way too close to home sometimes. I wish this was a reality, not the part where everyone died but I wish we could all find someone like Asuna and Kirito. Although their world may not be perfect they still work hard to survive and they find the best in everyone. I hope you all can do the same. Please recommend Sword Art Online to all of your friends because even if they think it is stupid at first they will realize how touching and amazing this story is. Hope you all are staying safe!!!

I remember in March, I had nothing to watch since I was bored. I saw sao on netflix so I clicked. Little did I know that I&#39;d love the show so much. I already knew after the first episode id love it. And aincrad made me so happy and sad. If it wasn&#39;t for sao, I probably wouldnt of been an anime fan.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you sao, making me homesick for something that I never had. And having such a beautiful soundtrack.<br><br><br><br>I hope somebody reads this, it took a while<br><br><br>Edit: I listened again to a tender feeling and I got absolute chills down my spine it was amazing

every time I listen to this I get that nostalgic feeling. This was my first actual anime that I wanted to watch and I loved it. This soundtrack makes me remember those times and is also a factor into why I play the piano now. I‚Äôm so glad to be able to play this soundtrack for others in order to make others happy and experience the happiness that Sao brought me.

First song makes me wanna cry

It&#39;s funny and amazing how our, human&#39;s creations always have all our feelings from the heart in it... just like this anime.  All the things you would want to experience the future and some possibilities that might also happen. But still, there are sad times but we keep on going no matter what. We turn that sadness and longing for something like this anime and run, walk, crawl and create our own paths along the way. While we long for something genuine like the relationships of Asuna and Kirito, we would inevitably cross paths with others too. I wanna be like Kirito, Asuna and everyone in this anime. Because no matter what, they never gave up! Even Akihiko Kayaba even his consciousness is inside that world, his own creation. We have a lot of ourselves created by ourselves in the past. As we time moves on, second by second, minute by minute, we continue to evolve. SAO is a big part of my childhood, it inspires me to never give up to be honest. As I am writing this, many people can relate... my emotions going through my entire body from my head and my heart. Some rain might fall hard, just like gravity! But even if so, the rainbow continues on... be it a thunder, hurricane, or tsunami, there will be beauty and peace, no matter what. People really unite when we have a common enemy and we see our true selves and even create families with people we dont know! Our true friends are true family, I hope I can be able to have friends like that. Who can handle my cringe, my true self, and my reality and fantasy. So go on, and flu like the dandelions through the sky as we leave our homes, we shall come back stronger mentally and physically. Cry out loud inside like a rain and make sure you form a rainbow. Sayonara, and I wish you good luck on everything you do.

I&#39;m distracted looking through the comments of this vid instead of doing my high school application. Lol, gotta get back to it now. Thx for the soothing background noise.

How can I be home sick for a place I&#39;ve never been, I really hope someone makes a place like sao before I turn 20

Why was this such an amazing series? It&#39;s like everyone who watched it felt like that&#39;s where they belonged.

Man this is squeezing my heart so much! I really love this anime....

One of the best series ever! I love it so much!!!

i cried so many damn times to this anime.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>and only 1 movie was able to do the same thing

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1906">31:46</a> you are not alone. this soundtrack makes me cry. everytime a soundtrack plays it reminds me of the scenes it used to play on, like this one with asuna and yuuki. üò≠üò≠ mother‚Äôs rosario arc is one of the most emotional arcs in sao ;‚Äî;

SAO is not only a anime it&#39;s a emotions.<br>I wish to make a game like SAO trapped in this forever.

Thanks for your work. It&#39;s awesome

It is hard to explain but by listening to this, it felt like all of my stress, my anxiety, my problems were floating away.<br>I just love SAO<br>and it gets better with season 3 =D

Great pictures and beautiful music. You Are Not Alone made me cry again. If you&#39;ve seen the last episode of season 2, you know why.<br><br>Thanks for the video.

Soundtrack changed!? I have been hearing this for months. It sounds different

I believe this is the best anime ever. For the romance, and action, the perfect balance between suspenseful action music, and soft peaceful music.  Sword art online has everything the perfect anime needs. Sad deaths, and happy endings. The world building in this show is beautiful, and all the characters have a bond. Cant wait for a fourth season. :)

Relaxing with some Fantasy and Beautiful melodies . . . =^.^=<br>==‚ñ∫Listen Beautiful Healing Piano Mix: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivo7ysKPjOc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivo7ysKPjOc</a>

Let your soul and spirit fly. :)

Wow this takes me back to days gone by... such a beautiful soundtrack

Sao/Aincrad is the perfect world for anyone. You can be what you want to be. You can make new friends. You can travel into the unexpected. The beautiful landscape, the warmth of the all time sun, the warmth of you loved ones. No leader of the world. Just pure happiness. No sadness to be seen. Cheerful children running in the street. Friends always by your side. It makes me so sad to see how such a beautiful world came to an end. Everyone says sword art online is a horrible show. The people who say that don&#39;t realize the beauty of sao. All the haters are focusing on is the fighting or action. They dont see the beautiful world soaring in front of their eyes, the delight in romance. To see happiness everywhere in the air. As the real world once was, dont worry everyone. Someday i will find out how to make this a reality. no matter if i lose a leg or an eye in the making. The real world is crumbling away slowly. And im sure everyone would love and give everything to see sao at its finest in real life. This soundtrack and show makes me so emotional and realize how superior Aincrad is comparing to our world. Even if its a 10 minute look into the world. I want to see such a wonderful creation come to reality. Thanks Akihiko Kayaba for a brilliant influence on our lives. I wrote this long paragraph because all this got me into my feels. Im not fishing for likes, i just want everyone to know its ok to cry, its ok to wish things, someday somehow we can work together to make this happen :) love you guys. hope your doing ok during quarantine :)

I hope Kirito and Asuna will have there happily ever after.

I saw SAO like 6 times and i want see it again. I LOVE IT &lt;3

OMG I CANT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I CRIED THO<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I CRIED FOR LIKE FOUR HOURS BC I THOUGHT THEY WERE BOTH DED , AND THEN WHEN YUI DIED I CRIED FOR HER BC SHES SO PRECIOUS, AND THEN HE WENT L0OKING FOR HER IN THE HOSPITAL AND THAT SHATTED MY HEART AND WHENEVER THEY WERE HAVING A &quot;MY HEART BELONGS TO YOU MOMENT&quot;, I CRIED EVEN HARDER. (i know this sounds pathetic but  I cry over anime A LOT)

This anime. This ripped a whole in my heart, and left me broken for months. I will never recover. This is forever in my mind.

SAO the best<br><br>Ahh... i hope this anime never ends...üëå

Maybe the best present I will get today. I really love sword art online, Merry Christmas! Thanks for all the great videos.

I&#39;m rewatching SAO for the second time, and liking it even more than the first time watching it...<br>This track is amazing. The music is nice of course, but even better is how it actually reminds me of scenes in the anime and it just makes me so happy listening to it!.!.!.!

&#39;Is this love&#39; Shows image of kirito and leafa<br><br>Me:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>No ‚ù§

Thank you very much for making this. All these shows soundtracks are so beautiful. This one and it‚Äôs story line really hit the heart. Absolutely beautiful.

Thank you for making another Sword Art Online compilation for us to enjoy! ^^<br>And Merry Christmas!

Thnx for getting no adds in between. Love it

First song started and I cried :( anime has been such a huge part of my life and sao was on of my first animes I really really enjoyed it makes me sad too see all the time that has passed and how I will never be able to relive my youth and we all should try to make the most of our youth because we won‚Äôt always be around.

2018 still love SAO...

the second song makes me cry and gives me the feeling of being away from home

Anyone here after Valve announced their Brain VR Interface will be ready for devs by 2022? SAO is almost here.

2020 and  still here. We all know that first song on this list will always hit the hardest. Like damnnnn.

Listened to this while reading the novel, really helped set the mood, thanks dude!

I was never right for the hero type of role .. I admit it<br>With my heart shivering in fear<br>I can see today&#39;s reflected in each past tear<br><br><br>Even so, it has been calling the heavens to me<br>But I cannot hide all the emptiness inside my fleeting heart<br><br><br>Once in my dreams I rose and soared<br>No matter how I&#39;m knocked around or beaten down<br>I will stand up, restored<br><br><br>All of my love has yet to wake<br>I know your strength is what I lack<br>You&#39;ve got my back and know that I&#39;ve got yours<br><br><br>I have you to thank for lighting up the dark<br>Because you&#39;re here with me<br>Our dreams will soar free forever<br><br><br>(I wanna always be with you .. I give you everything I have)<br><br><br>I could never find light to guide me through the night<br>And with one touch, I&#39;d recall every memory<br>All too precious to not hold them all close to me<br><br><br>It&#39;s tempting to close your eyes and turn from the world<br>But it&#39;s bittersweet, like you&#39;ve somehow missed a beat with no restart<br><br><br>When every wish has overlapped<br>You&#39;ll realize if you carry on with every dawn, your hesitation fades<br><br><br>All of your scars will disappear<br>I will become your sword and shield<br>This Crossing Field&#39;s the path that we select<br><br><br>The promise we made will last for all our days<br>If it&#39;s our bonds we&#39;ll live by, I will put my faith in you<br><br><br>I only need one miracle<br>Can you not hear me call at all?<br>Until that day, I&#39;ll keep screaming your name<br><br><br>Once in my dreams I rose and soared<br>No matter how I&#39;m knocked around or beaten down<br>I will stand up, restored<br><br><br>All of my love has yet to wake<br>I know your strength is what I lack<br>You&#39;ve got my back and know that I&#39;ve got yours<br><br><br>I have you to thank for lighting up the dark<br>Because you&#39;re here with me<br>Our dreams will soar free forever<br><br><br>(I wanna always be with you<br>I wanna hold you tight right now<br>I swear that I&#39;ll be who you choose<br>I&#39;ll give you everything I have)<br>/Lyrics by: Amanda Lee

Using these osts as my skyrim‚Äôs soundtrack is the best choice i made so far

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=720">12:00</a> JUST LOOK AT HOW BEAUTIFUL ALO IS, this song is so relaxing and the images really make me remember lots of scenes from SAO

Remember when the first episodes of SAO where actually making you feel emotional and were so thrilling watching them for the first time?

2019? SAO forever  :)

I‚Äôve played a lot of Pokemon as a kid. I always got hand-me-down consoles and games, so my first experiences were with Yellow, Gold and Fire Red. When I listen to those soundtracks, immediately nostalgia flows through my mind in a way I‚Äôve never really had with anything else. It‚Äôs only been a couple of years since I first watched SAO, but somehow the beautiful soundtrack that it provided now gives me that exact same feeling.

I am such a crazy fan of vr and everytime I hear something about vr advancing it‚Äôs reminds me of sao and how close we really are to something like this. Guys I‚Äôm telling you, sao is going to be a reality with 10 years. People don‚Äôt even realize it, I can‚Äôt wait for some developer to perfectly recreate the feel and creation of sao so I and so many others could experience it.

Try not to cry challenge <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=2">0:02</a> I&#39;m done <b>crying overflow starts</b>

&quot;My life belongs to you&quot;

Sao touched everyone&#39;s hearts when they first watched it, so beautiful and with grace.

just listening to the music after so long watching the anime feels so different and so good that you remember the anime just with the soundtrack and wish you had the same reaction as when you first saw it

I never realised how nice the music in this anime was.

first song i wanted 2 cry but i was in class i cant resist listening so i went 2 the bathroom and cried T-T i love SAO!

this is so relaxing , i dont understand how anybody could even dislike this anime

This soundtrack feels nostalgic, even though I only recently watched the series. It is so amazing and beautiful. I actually don&#39;t think a better soundtrack could possibly be written.<br><br>It just makes me wanna cry, and I don&#39;t know why. It&#39;s like I miss something from these songs, even though I can re-watch it whenever I like.

thanks you for this song of SAO arigato soul of wings

this made me realize that in the wake of trying to survive, you will meet somebody along the way, no matter how long it takes, you have to go with the flow and wait, good things come to those who are patient

I never knew how relaxing the music from the anime is üò≠ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è (I LOVE IT SO MUCH üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠)

que hermosos recuerdo, el segundo anime que mire y con este me hice otaku. creo que ya es hora de volverlo a ver.

„Åì„ÅÆ‰ΩúÂìÅ„Å´Âá∫‰ºö„Åà„Å¶„Éõ„É≥„Éà„Å´„Çà„Åã„Å£„Åü„ÅÅ„ÅÅÔºÅÔºÅ

When the first song started, i felt a longing to go back to a place ive never been. <br><br>Sao was my first anime i started with and though i do have a few problems it&#39;s always going to be one of my favourites thanks to the beautiful art, music, and storyline.

I&#39;m sooo happy that theres no ads!

This music makes me want to experience full dive VR. It&#39;s not coming anytime soon, though it&#39;s definitely gonna happen in my lifetime. And once it happens, I will be there

2019 people? Still one of the best. ‚ô•Ô∏èüíØ

Beautiful soundtrack perfect for studying ^¬∞^

Me listening to this soundtrack: <br>Thats enough to make a grown man cry <br><br><br><br>And thats alright

Sao is the first anime that I watch in my life,sao show me that you could do anything if you really work for it.... eventhought a lot of people said that this anime is not as good as other anime,this anime would be my number 1 anime of all time.I would agree that there&#39;s a lot of other anime that much better than Sao but..... being greater doesn&#39;t mean being the bestüòä

I like it very much ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Thank you so much The soul of Wind!!!!

Wow what a magician you are. I am relaxing and meditating with your piano and it&#39;s takes me to another planet and to higher frequency and next level before I die. I want to fly away again and again with wonderful musics like yours.

Este video lo llevo escuchando desde hace a√±o y algo o m√°s, es mi remedio de relajaci√≥n, bueno, uno de ellos, para calmar la ansiedad, para pensar en otras cosas, o pensar en lo que me perturba desde una perspectiva m√°s profunda, es ese momento de razonamiento que tengo al d√≠a,  es ese momento de relajaci√≥n que tengo al d√≠a,  o es la huella que dejo de fondo de mientras hago cualquier otra actividad cotidiana, este puedo decir sin lugar a dudas que es mi video favorito de YT, por protagonizar mi banda sonora favorita, personalmente esta es la que encaja conmigo en todos los sentidos, de verdad, os puedo asegurar que este video en concreto me ha servido de desahogo emocional en incontables ocasiones.

SAO was the best anime ever üòç

This definitely brings back memories üòäüòä

Today is November 5th of the year 2020 it&#39;s been 3 years since this video has been uploaded and all I want to say is thank you the soundtrack everything about this it&#39;s beautiful

Just finished my Trigonometry homework as this video ended...so perfect! I do recognize that SAO has a lot left to be desired, but the OST by Yuki Kajiura is just amazing T^T

„Åô„Åî„ÅèÂàá„Å™„ÅÑÊ∞óÊåÅ„Å°„Å´„Å™„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Åü

Me: ok study time<br><br><b>.  clicks on video</b> <br><br><br><br><br>Me: oh shit why am I crying

I watched sao back when I was a kid and it still feels like a dream more or less, with how far technology has come, it might not be too far when we are able to create a world such as sao. I&#39;m currently studying as an engineer and plan on working in the VR field and I wish it to be my life&#39;s work to produce a reality such as the one portayed by this anime. I want to help people who might be bedridden and can&#39;t experience life like everyone else, but this dream is really selfish because someone close to me would give anything to be outside.

I just wish that I can forget this anime so I can watch it all over again. Sao will forever be in my heart

Thanks as always for creating such good compilations :)

I think the best classical music is present on SAO

Nothing&#39;s so calming for me as listening to the SAO I OST.. All these memories rushing into my head.. I&#39;m really grateful for knowing this masterpiece of art. üñ§ I&#39;m just  watching SAO Alizication: Beginning for the 1 time and I&#39;m so happy that there are many episodes to come for me. SAO makes my heart weight lighter. <br><br>- Greetings from Germany ‚ù§ I hope it&#39;s proper English, sorry if not.

I have just begun watching this show, im on episode 18 i am in love with Asuna, i think the scenes of all theyre intimate moments makes me so happy and overjoyed it brings tears to my eyes how somebody could have created art this beautiful. For a first time viewing its absolutely gorgeous. So adorable and beautiful.

&#39;She is still sleeping&#39; Made me cry, as it reminded me of Yuuki and Asuna. :(

ive looked at a lot of comments here and im proud to say ive started watching sao recently, im halfway through season 2 and so far its been incredible. i already see sao as my Favourite anime of all time and im exited to see more of season 2!

I just wanna live out the rest of my life in this picture, a world like this. Beauty and harmony and peace of mind with people I love, good food, soulful music, and breathtaking sights.

This soundtrack, it makes me homesick for a place I&#39;ve never been

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1908">31:48</a> RIP yuuki konno ‚ù§üò≠üíîüíî

16 seconds and this video received my like!!! Amazing...

THE FEELS ARE STRONG WITH THIS ONE MY SON <b>&lt;-&lt;</b>

i love it

pretty good study music right here, theres something about having this on whilst i study my japanese

This is one of the best soundtracks ever in any isekai anime I&#39;ve watched. It makes me feel like I&#39;m also trapped in that world no matter how deadly or dangerous it is, it creates so much heavy feels,... I can&#39;t explain it XD

I love SAO, and this music makes me nostalgic, of the good old times that they where trapped in SAO! say I&#39;m crazy all you want, but i like it better when they where trapped in there. That&#39;s the one mistake that&#39;s been bugging me a lot. The story is called SWORD ART ONLINE they should be trapped in SWORD ART ONLINE! even though there is 2 seasons (which i watched) sword art online ended for me a long time ago. I still love it, but it loved it SO much more before. At least ordinal scale is coming out.

SAO is my favourite anime while i listen the songs i cry ;-)<br>this anime is so beautiful ;-)

sao reminds me of early mornings when the sun is coming up and there‚Äôs dew on the grass for some reason. Maybe it‚Äôs because when they were in the actual game it was mostly just... fields of grass that looked so peaceful. Man i wish i could someday experience something like that

<b>best anime that started me to watch more anime, and I will never forget it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</b>

Can&#39;t wait for &quot;Ordinal Scale&quot;. Who else is waiting!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èBtw the music is amazing!! I&#39;m listening it this while I&#39;m studying.

Love the song between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=218">3:38</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=326">5:26</a>. my favorite.

How can I be so nostalgic for a world I never lived in ? And which technically hasn&#39;t even happened yet, since it starts in 2022 if I remember right.<br><br>I was already feeling homesick for SAO when this video came out 4 years after the anime, and now it&#39;s 4 more years. Jeez. Still watching War of Underworld though, love this characters.

Wow what a magician you are. I am relaxing and meditating with your piano and it&#39;s takes me to another planet and to higher frequency and next level before I die. I want to fly away again and again with wonderful musics like yours.

I miss the sereies. I am eagerly  waiting for season 3 part 2 . When Asuna enter into the underworld.üòôüòô.<br>Edit <br>I watch this sereies because od Kirito and asunaüòäüòäüòä

AAWHHHHHH ITS TOO HARD NOT TO CRY!!

SAO music in the backgroud while playing genshin is a masterpiece

This soundtrack is so beautiful, its peaceful and it help&#39;s me to relieved stress.

these are beautiful song they make me fall asleep in 5 minutes and it&#39;s sad as well

This music is life !!! thank you for this awsome job &lt;3

I teard up every episode from the 1st season. Even the music makes me tear up, thank you SAO for all you have done.

The atmosphere / atmosphere of SAO is definitely the best. So magical ... I love the songs

Does this genuinely depress anyone else? Knowing that if you&#39;re a guy, you&#39;ll NEVER find a woman like Asuna and vice versa? Cos real talk that depresses me a little...

<b>This song makes my Heart melt. üíò</b>

When I listen to this I get flooded with memories of me watching the show for the first time , not knowing what to expect... I wish I can go back to that again and again

i always hear these song before i go to sleep, it‚Äôs so relaxing, so i need this collection on spotify please :)

ASUNAAAAA-SAN!!!!<br>KIRITO-KUN!!!!<br><br>Welllp....that&#39;s my weeb shit for the day

My life is a joke when i think about the world they are in, im still waiting to go to the place i disire the most the place i never been but feel like i have been, a place where i can be myself and not lying to yourself a place where i can do what i want, a place that i so much disire i cant describe or the feeling of, it makes me so full and warmth to think about that, i hope i can be there one day and really life.....

Just wanna remind everyone that kirito didnt have the best life in sao. Ofc he found the love of his life and all but he still lost alot of friends back then. I saw sao for the first time like 1 year ago and I loved it. Ofc I got the same dreams as everyone of u guys/girls. Guys wanna be kirito and girls asuna. ( Dont mind my bad english guys ;D)

This anime will always be the best anime that I ever watched, my first ever anime that I watched, watched it when season 2 didn&#39;t even existed. Rewatched it 4+ times currently rewatching it for nostalgia and new season.

Anyone notice that this came out on Christmas? That feels special to me.

If SAO was a real thing I would kill to get it

And the nostalgia hits. Wow. I need to rewatch this series.

I love sword art online so I love this and I just love it so much so I&#39;m thanking them for who made it SAO IS my most most fav shoe in the world and nothing will beat it so thanks so much to ever made this

I&#39;ll always have a soft spot for this miserably written show.

Nice choice, very relaxing. Good choice on the Picture to.

thank you for your work!—Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –∑–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω–Ω—É—é —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É !!!

Ngl, I don&#39;t care about what y&#39;all are saying about sao, but sao is what took me to the anime world and that it&#39;s music made me feel like &quot;This is Home, we can now rest.&quot;

I love the sword art online music that they use

Man I just started this anime last night, 28 february 2019, from around midnight to 7 a.m, time&#39;s passed so fast and daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn I never thought I would love it so much. Those songs, those feelings we get when watching their journey  .. Gosh I will never forget how good it was despite everything we can read on the net.<br>You know this feeling you get when you start a new anime, and learn that it isn&#39;t even over yet. And that games also exist and are not that bad ? <br>Hell yeah someone&#39;s gonna spend a lot of money but i&#39;m fine with that.<br><br><br><b>SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY</b><br><br>EDIT : <b>OH SHIT WASN&#39;T READY FOR ALFHEIM</b>

2020 , quarantined , stress reliever as always , i always feel homsick to a place i‚Äôve never been whenever i hear this soundtrack, and then the feeling like u want to rewatch the anime , i rlly wish i have the ability to forget stuffs easily so that i can rewatch this everytime üíú

The soul of wind ur the best ‚úå<br>Thnx a lotüòÑüòä

I love SAO ‚ô• <br>Thanks for your video ~

To me SAO will always be my first anime. I liked season 1 from start to beginning, everyone says SAO is not a good start to anime I disagree, SAO defines what people&#39;s imaginations could bring into animation, just like we have seen in Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s films. For me to put it into a few words, &quot;SAO is the dream I wish to live in&quot;.

I&#39;ve never cried so much until I saw this. I love SAO so much.

best music ive ever heard

Beautiful as always.üòçthank you.üòä I wish you a happy marry critmas from Germany. üéÑ üéÑ üéÑ.üòÄ and a happy New year.üéâ üéâ üéâ üòä

very nostalgic when I first watched it came to my mind I had a lot of fun while watching

Honestly the music for SAO is just so beautiful and peaceful I&#39;ll always remember that first time I watched Ep 1 of SAO even if it was just a year ago lol feels longer

me: oh this music is so beautiful!<br><b>gets an ad in the middle of it</b><br>GOD FRICKEN!

Wanna know what helps this epidemics quarantine better a.d more relaxing?<br><br><br><br><br>SAO! And this beautiful mix of the ost!

I think the selection of music of this BGM is wonderful. I was moved!<br>Please also exert yourself now.

Oh god literally all of these make me so nostalgic I know where ALL OF THEM are from-

It&#39;s 2020? Well time flys so fast I&#39;m dying soon I&#39;m glad that I found music so calm thank you üíï sao is best lol

listening to these melodies, I want to die, romantically.

I am crying now ;-;

thank you so much, becouse you made this list song. I so love it

this sound track takes me home, to the place I long for and for the places I have yet to go

Nice songs :)

Sword Art Online Alicization War Of Underworld<br>13-10-2019

Im used to people mocking me because SAO is my favorite anime, but when i listen to this music its still so clear to me why i love this anime so much

Does anyone else just want to go back and re experience when they first got into anime.  I wish I could just go back to those days when things were easier

My fav one for always is/was/and will be a tender feeling

Yay SAO this april<br><br><br><br><br>Corona Virus: Hiii

Thank you!

This is music to my ears... TBH iwas a hater before, but when i met my bf he told me how amazing it is so i gave it a shot, and thats when i realize he was alot like kirito, he was very skilled when it comes to playing online games, and i was like asuna was  a little skilled but not strong enough so he helped me, there was this one time i mate a little girl who wanted me to be her mama in the game and thats when i realize that our love story wal a little bit like sao but we didint meet online we met at our school, so i am very happy to have him and our daugher

I love Sword Arte Online ‚ù§Ô∏è

+The Soul of Wind I am relaxing, alright? How about you? I can guess that you aren&#39;t LOL! Well, it&#39;s good to see that the channel is heading towards a different direction :3 A happy 2K17 for all

Listening to this makes me lowkey emotional ngl

Such a positive community we should really make a SAO server where we can all talk about it and have fun

Now just 2 years until SAO comes.., I wish I could trapped in the Aincrad and meet other players that need meüôÇüò≠

Sao is definitely a good gateway anime for anyone who enjoys a good love story with lessons in almost every episode and family oriented. Sao now and always. 2020.

So relaxing i almost fell asleep and i watcht  the hole anime this made me want to watch it again it was sooo good

when dem goosebumps hit harder then your grades

2019 still love Sao...

The picture thats posted for Friendly Feelings has me smiling soool hard. Omg i love this anime üò≠...happy tears

2019 Anyone? We bout to have full dive VR any year now... r-right?

I love anime i watch it allllllllllll the time really trust me

This deserves 10 million views!

I SEE ASUNA I CLICK

The first song is best known as the &quot;Kirito and Asuna Reunion Theme!&quot;

Who is listening this at 2019?

this show means so much to me man :)

No god <br>no please<br>is Sad<br>sword art online is the Best anime

ÊúÄÂàù„Åã„ÇâÊ≥£„Åë„Çã

You don‚Äôt want to know how much this music contributes to the crying I did while watching this amazing show.

It&#39;s just so beautiful and at the same time sad to see how so many people here in the comments just want a more beautiful life like in sao ... everyone really only wants to be accepted by other people and would like to have a partner for life with them one could live in this beautiful world from sao ... the fact that so many only have to cry through the sao soundtracks shows that this anime has shaped our lives ... somehow we all just long for our dream ... as sad as it is, i&#39;m glad not to be the only one who feels this way and i hope that our wish will somehow come true, even if in another life. i&#39;m a person who hates real life and so often I think to myself why there is so much hatred and wars in the world ... in sao everyone is friendly everyone helps everyone and everything is peaceful, of course there are always a few people who are just angry but that fortunately only very few are there ...everyone has this sad, weird feeling in their stomach or a sore heart if they only think back to the sao time. I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m not the only one ... thank you guys!

Props and a cookie to the first vr programmer to make FairyTail and SAO fuse into one mind frying vrmmorpg/ba/ow (Virtual Reality Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game+ Battle Arena + Open World). No like seriously this needs to happen. Please. I need this to escape from this shithole that is reality sometimes XD

Luckily, I downloaded this videos

what i most like with sao is the world was made for get connection with other people make friends and have the best fun ever and i think the nerualink made by elon musk will be the best think ever

one of my favorite anime I love how kirito and asuna fight for each other and how deep their trust is for one another<br>how I wish SOA was real.....every episode has something important to teach.

After about 4 or 5 years, I rewatched SAO and I literally cried

Who was here in 2019?

i admit even a cold hearted person like me has a soft and gentle side. i just dont like to show it

this anime is sick...it‚Äòs overhatet(!)i mean i‚Äòm not lying when i say that this anime saved my life.Everytime i hear this,it makes me so happy...I wish i can watch this show like it was the first time.This show is a  big and important thing in my life...

God, the first track is so perfect at encapsulating the feeling of SAO underneath it all.

almost 5 month i litsen to this soundtrack

This is the first anime i love the main girl. Now i have a girlfriend like Asuna :)). I love her so much. By the way, the soundtrack is very good:))))))))

I love listening to this while I study,draw and sleep

Simply beautiful :)

&quot;) I do not want to CRY <br>3&gt; my best anime

Alright now, who is gonna make a real-life version os SAO. Just lmk and we can figure something out

Omg I just noticed I was crying without noticing so much good memories that never actually happened

When i watch the full season and episode i litteraly cried by far this is my favorate anime SAO 4EVER!!

„Åä„ÇÑ„Åô„Åø„Å™„Åï„ÅÑüò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥üò¥

2020 Anybody? SAO ü•∞üòç

I feel like for a lot of people this anime has represented a way of escaping the real world. It&#39;s weird how powerful it can be when you&#39;re in the right mood despite not being that great. I think it&#39;s truely special though and it holds a particular place in my heart.

Man I feel chills, I had a feeling of the first time watching this show like a flashback. :(

Yaassssss finally!!!! Thank you and merry Christmas soul of wind \(^o^)/

Hope people still watch this anime in 2019. It really is special ‚ô° and honestly I wish this world were real shshsj. Even if my life was at risk It would be so magical and exciting

&quot;she is still sleeping&quot; is the cause of my tears

After watching SAO again , I just realized I did find my ASUNA . while listening to this soundtrack it gives me goosbumps also nostalgic. SAO forever will always be my favorite anime!

yui,kirito,asuna you&#39;ve escaped the virtual world and reality now can you please escape the anime world and live here in the real world with all of us

ME AND MAH BRO CANNOT STUDY WITHOUT THIS. ‚ù§üëå

I like all songs, but the first one almost makes me cry every time  :¬¥)<br>I don¬¥t think I will ever get over the fact that I will probably never be able to play a game like sao myself or to live in a beatiful world like that

I always feel ‚Äúthe peace‚Äù when i listen to these songs‚Ä¶relax‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm so confused. Why was the music changed?

I will always wait for someone like Asuna, Kirito&#39;s and Asuna&#39;s relationship was perfect as per my opinion.

Some bash SAO for what it has become. <br><br><b>But others still remember it for what it was. The first 14 episodes are never forgettable. It&#39;s proven time and time again with each reference.</b>

Thank you for song, its beautiful

I am super late into this anime. Anyone else just started watching SAO in 2018?

Im not gonna cry <br><br><br><br><br><br>Fuck it üò≠üò≠üò≠

Ive been searching for this video after a long time. Like its so hard to find it. Since i miss it so much. And FINALLYY!!<br>But... i think its changed. Before it has so much good melodies and now its just binaural..

Sao was my first anime ever... I&#39;m never gonna forget the feeling

wait the music has changed!? this ain&#39;t the same music that this video had 3-5years ago.

The saddest moment in sao was when it all started. Once you press play you cant go back. You take those 3 seconds to scroll and click the play button. You breathe in . And exhale. The shit but enjoyable anime has started and once it has  captivated your mind you cannot go back to who you were before. You have truly stepped into the weaboo realm. For me this anime was enjoyable however sadly the time where i had no taste in good anime. This, This is the reason why only you can watch this anime when you are a 9 year old.

Recently got a new 4K TV not too long ago. Then i got a new surround sound system. <br><br>Thought it was a prefect excuse to rewatch the series. It had been a while since I&#39;d seen it from the start. Feels so nostalgia now.

My nephew told me for years I should watch SAO and never did until one day when visiting, he put episode 1 on in the livjng room, and I got hooked ü•∞

Just over two years wait, almost there üòé

What happen it&#39;s not SAO theme song. something have been change for this clip cuz I always open this music clip in the past I remember the old version!!!

Well, I used to listen to this vid while doing my research paper back then. But believe me, what play right now is not what I used to listen to. Perhaps it changed regarding &quot;copy right&quot; or stuff but, yeaa it cant be help. Anyone feels the same?

chills, literal chills.

I really love it.. I&#39;m a big fan of SAO and every time when I hear this.. I feel that I&#39;m in the game

Du bist in Germanletsplay&#39;s Ark Playlist

i love Asuna

this music has a sort of magic to it and I love that it does

This video makes me want to re-watch Sword Art Online<br><br><br><br><br>Edit: I am now currently re-watching SAO

What happened to the music

Awesome music

Is it just me or the music changed

I close my eyes, lend back in a chair and listen to this music... I dont need more than this, my world&#39;s complete ^^

Did anyone try and watch this video recently and it‚Äôs not the right music, it‚Äôs like some peaceful music but not Sword Art Online music

Am i the only one thinking the music changed ? is it possible to do that ???

I hope Kirito wakes up in next episode 18

Hopefully there will be more shows like this to come i love this anime üòîüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

Very niccce

April 2019 people? :)

This soundtrack is out of this world

Anime is great. People who complain just don&#39;t know how to truly enjoy things. <br>Looking, or caring, about faults in anime simply ruins what the anime tries to achieve.<br><br>I watch anime without care, with no expectation, and the result: me having an idyllic impression of an anime. <br>Although true that this image can be easily shattered, I tend to usually avoid anime communities for this reason. <br><br><br>I&#39;m not sure why one would want to make themselves dislike something by looking for faults in that thing.<br>It simply introduces negative thoughts and feelings. It&#39;s not very healthy especially if that person watches anime on a regular.<br><br>And why is that? Because there&#39;s always something to complain about. <br><br>There will always be a thousand reasons to complain about any anime,<br>but there&#39;s never a reason why you shouldn&#39;t just enjoy it, carelessly.<br><br>Thank you for reading.

Whos here in 2019?

Wtf. Where‚Äôs the sao music? Was it all copyrighted?

I hope that in the future when I am still alive that they will make a VR so its just like this one where it really feels like ur alive and u can feel the wind and everything!

The 22nd floor of Aincrad, at the edge of the forest, on a beautiful lake...<br>A 16 year old me, with my young wife, and our adopted daughter, in a place where we could be young forever...<br><br>HEAVEN

i like this song..i cryüò≠and sad

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1205">20:05</a> this music makes me feel so sad everytime I listen to it<br><br><br><br><br>sorry if it&#39;s not a great sentence I&#39;m French ü•ñ  üá´üá∑

how did they even get the music this perfect <br>Incredible

I ask myself, if someday I&#39;ll listen the soul of wind without fell into tears again

I want to cry when i hear this soundtrack &lt;3

2019 and I still love SAO

The vid hasn‚Äôt even started and my chest already hurts. That kind of hurt you fell when you almost fall on a high place or see someone almost get badly hurt.

This literally makes me cry

the ads ruin everything

Is amazing!!!! This anime , I love &gt;w&lt;

to think this was 2016 omg im in the feels now:)

This is just damn beautiful.

My favourite songs were a tender feeling, with my friend. reply urs

This song made me cry and i wished i could be as lucky as kirito i also just realised some of these song were in so its really sad so is full of emotions we want to release they&#39;ve learned me a lessonon how we should always be positive no matter what I&#39;m grateful i watched this anime

Listening this makes me to go into the anime world ‚ù£Ô∏è<br><br>Alas! If I really could go inside anime world ü§ç

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1710">28:30</a> the best

This music is so relaxing that it can help you sleep.

It just me or all of this sound is not like before?

What happened to the SAO soundtracks on this video?

I miss the simple days. The days of tv shows and toys. The days where running around outside was more fun than staying indoors. The times spent with family was more often and less strained. I miss the days before we all grew up and realized, we won‚Äôt get a fairytale, we don‚Äôt get a musical, we don‚Äôt even live in a comic. I wish we could all go back to before, when our innocence and imagination took us places we never thought we could go. Treasure each and every moment you have. Don‚Äôt hide away from others. Reach out and love each other, find someone to love, just like in SAO. You may not get an automatic fairytale, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt build your own. Live life to the fullest. Smile brightly, cry deeply, laugh heartily.

The imaginary world, which caught me . . .<br>During listening to this first 11-12 song, I always feel inside of me, I&#39;m in this world . . .

SAO BEST ANIME EVERRRRRRRR :)

Who was here in 2019????

Running around in SAO 2017:<br>lets get to stage 100!!!<br><br>Running around in SAO 2021: COVID19!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will give you COVID19!!!!!!!!!

Oh the memories üò≠üò≠

Wtf? Why is the music different?

after watched war of underworld i cme here

MASTERPIECE

This makes me want to live in Sao forever. Just thinking of someday playing sao with my boyfriend makes me feel so happy. And maybe bringing a child on an awesome virtual adventure with us. Sao is amazing üíï I will always fight my heart out for you, Luke (My Kirito)

What happened???? Why did the music change?

WTF cambiaron el audio, este video tenia la playlist del ost de SAO muy bien ordenada ... que lastima :/

Every time I listen to this music I cry subconsciously  üíñ üò≠

I love the first song it‚Äôs so lovely it reminds me of their love and how one day hopefully I‚Äôll be able to be just like them have someone to love üíï

It so relaxing .............Zzz

Uh what happened to the music? Has it been copyrighted?

Good Stuff!

BEATIFUL :,)

For everyone trying to find the old song until this one is fixed here‚Äôs a copy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGS-O9wyB0o">https://youtu.be/lGS-O9wyB0o</a>

What happened to this video, where is the music??

2021 here, when i close my eyes hearing the music reminds me season 3 ending ;)

You can hate the series or not, but you can&#39;t hate the music ;) A tender feeling really makes me feel happy ;)

12/5/19 <br><br>I love you dear friend, and I well cherish every moment I have with you, if your sick I well be by you and nurse you back to health, if you are filled with sadness and your tears flow onto your cheeks I will give you my joy and wipe your tears, if you are cold and lonely I will give you my warmth and solace, if you lose your memories of us I would create new ones and make you fall in love with me over and over again, if you‚Äôre scared I will give you my protection, if you‚Äôre in danger let me be by your side, My dear love you are my sword and I am your shield, you are my sun and I am your moon, you are the daughter of the moon and sun and I am the son of the earth and the heaven, we are inseparable I Love you my beautiful friend. I love you, I love you ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.- Jacob Xiongnu

Where&#39;s the SAO music? Did the uploader change the video?

I fell asleep during the sound track and i had the best dream ever.

Excellent.

2019 anybody????

Warum ist das in Glps Playlist f√ºr ark?

I didn&#39;t realize how much I missed this.

kirito is waking up in the next episode, lets go my boy, you need to save everyone

SAO is the best movie ever ;), i really really really really really really really really............... love it , i hope season 3 is maded :)

Is it me or the music that‚Äôs playing isn‚Äôt even sao music?

This brings back memories of seeing starburst stream and going WOOWWWWWWWW and then the the final aincrad fight and just liek fainting from epicness

Wish I could experience this anime second time, like it was first time.

I get it. The plot was shitty, and I agree to some extent. But man. It&#39;s just so nostalgic to me. The music makes it all the more beautiful. Even if I tried, I can&#39;t hate Sword Art Online.

(Ignore this, I&#39;m just making sure I remember which part i&#39;m at when i come back to it) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1262">21:02</a>

A tender feeling is the best emotional soundtrack ever

Listening to Sao music brings back so many memories of when I first watched it I can‚Äôt wait till real life nerve gear comes out

Who is here in 2019?

WTF HAPPENED TO THE SOUND ?

Anyone from 2021? LOVE IT WHILE  STUDYING

I hope one day, i can trust in someone as much as Kirito to Asuna and have the same trust reflected to me like Asuna would... but unfortunately something like that doesn‚Äôt happen to people like me.     If you Reading i want you to know to never give up on any small dream you once had or having, be strong for those around you and for yourself

The video ads really disturb any relaxing, please go back to normal ads

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1428">23:48</a>

Anyone listening to this after hearing the news of this arc coming back again??

All the memories of the anime are so beautiful I hope that I will forget all that I can watch the anime again with new beautiful feelings for me it&#39;s the best anime I love it

is this changed ?

What the fuck happened to the music?

Listening to this gets me excited for something like these games to come out in real life

When i first watch sao in 2016 i was super excited to finish it but now i think i don&#39;t want to  end it series until now still watching in this 2020<br>SAO FOREVER

I love Sao and hope there will be a game like this in some years... It&#39;s soo great

The memories this brings back... sheesh

This never gets old. I love japanese music!

Beautiful.

A wiseman once answered me when i asked &quot;would you go to sao?&quot; They said &quot;yes, im not there for a long time, just a good one&quot; and i find this truly accurate

this hit hard

I KNOW that i am not the only one who is almost crying from the nostalgia...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>btw i AM SO FREAKING EXCITED for the new movie SAO progressive.. I CAN&#39;T FREAKING WAIT! Anyone else?

Just few more days before Alicization pt. 2. Can&#39;t wait.

This is nice üòä

Even if you dislike SAO, you can&#39;t deny that the OST is amazing :3

This soundtrack brings me back, when I watched SAO. Good Times. I&#39;m still waiting for someone like Asuna. Haha, which will never come.

I‚Äôm a grown man but when I hear this I get so nostalgic I cry

Even haters have to agree that SAO has:<br>Beautiful OSTs <br>Breathtaking animation<br>Banger Openings<br>Beautiful art style<br>Amazing sound effects<br>This anime isn&#39;t perfect, it has flaws. But I can say it has better quality than 99% of anime ever existed.

This community is so nice there‚Äôs not even a singe dis like on any of the comments

Where my peace isüòå‚ù§üå∏

a moment in the soul can last forever

You can say what you want about sao but you‚Äôve got to admit that this music is beautiful

Thanks

I miss the first time I watched SAO. The soundtrack is beautiful and calming. I am enjoying the new series now though. Its awesome, can‚Äôt wait for Kirito to wake up next episode.üò≠üò≠ü§£

More anime needs loving melody ost music like this. And emotional. I like this one.

bro this soundtrack makes me feel all sorts of different ways

I like how they are all in order

Im sorry.. I&#39;m crying.. Asuna-san, Yuii-chan.. mina-san mo..gomen ne.. hountoni gomenüò≠üò≠

this anime soundtracks really is amazing, next to Rise of Shield Hero which deserve a huge praise!!

Thinkin about full dive VR this few years, wishing for it to happen especially SAO.... but.............<br>a... moment, clearly impossible to happen unless all researchers focus on making full dive VR, and same for developers.... This is basically impossible, it would take a decade or two even more for VR to be developed. Let&#39;s just hope we are still alive when full dive VR is done.

hurm....seems like i missed such a wonderful soundtrack from the anime

This song gives me memories of a place that can&#39;t be mine and of characters I can&#39;t meet... A homy feeling...

God bless you, soul of the wind!

I wish I could experience SAO the game itself while listening to these songs.

All the delays up until now it&#39;s finally here!

I closed my eyes and imaged my own world , hoping that I can stay there forever

thanks for no ads  (:

Bruh time seem to flow a lot faster when I&#39;m listening to this

first and forever favorite anime

Áôí„Åó„ÅÆÊõ≤„Å∞„Å£„Åã„ÅßÁú†„Çå„Åù„ÅÜ„Äú

i miss sao. like when they were in aincrad, it should&#39;ve been longer.

ÂæÖ„Å£„Å¶‚Ä¶31ÂàÜ„Åã„ÇâÊ∂ôËÖ∫ÂÆåÂÖ®„Å´Â¥©„Çå„Å¶„Åå„ÅëÂ¥©„ÇåÈ°îÈù¢Â¥©Â£äËµ∑„Åì„Åó„Åü

Very nicee.music ..üòÅüôè thanks you

I think that soundtrack is about the only consistently good thing about SAO that everyone can agree on.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8">0:00:00</a> Everyone knows that tenders are a mark of distinction, but I&#39;m afraid that no amount of tenders will save you in the end. We diesels are taking over, and we don&#39;t need tenders to make us important, not even one

i wish i can watch sao like its the first time, if this series come to an end it might be one of my greatest heartbreaks

I love this...although it makes feel like I wanna cry...Yuuki Eugeo come back!!!!

I was like <b>WHAT?!?!THE SOUL OF WIND POSTED THIS?!!??!?!</b>

Really wish this anime didn‚Äôt fall into that category of ‚Äúyou better hate this thing like the rest of us or we don‚Äôt like you‚Äù I hear this anime get a really stupid amount of hate but if it was so bad it wouldn‚Äôt have performed so well. Same goes for a game like fortnite. Lots of people liked it, and because people liked it so much people hated it. And now you wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead saying you like it because you‚Äôll get bashed for doing so. I HATE this bandwagon effect. People that have never even seen sao will say it‚Äôs ‚Äútrash‚Äù and for ‚Äúnewbies with shit taste‚Äù it‚Äôs not a problem to dislike something. But to dislike someone because they love something you don‚Äôt is just plain immature. Stop whining about the plot holes. Stop crying over the plot armor. And stop calling it a harem anime. Instead of nitpicking every little thing you can find to dislike it appreciate it for what it is. An anime that gave us a whole now world do fantasize about. A world that can as of now only exist in our most exiting dreams.

look man i know everyone hates sao and i get it there are bad aspects of it but i grew up with this and every time i take a break from binge-watching new anime I will always come back to Sao...Sao is my home and ive never felt happier watching a show, no show has ever made me feel as many emotions as Sao.

Aun en 2020 me sigo viendo el anime todos los dias

Great.

:thumbsup<br>‚ù§‚ù§

Eu nunca chorei com m√∫sica nenhuma mas Sword Art Online mano √© incrivelmente incrivel

Love the anime grown up with it ‚öîÔ∏è

A thunder feeling and at nightfall alway remember this soundtrack 7 years ago in memory childhood

4 a√±os escuchandolo, siempre me eleva el animo, me hace encontrar sentimientos y me motiva a todo, sonidos expectaculares, melodias alegres y relajantes, ty sao

When ever i listen this song i feel to much peaceful. This song is my favourite. üò≠üò≠üò≠

SAO not only have good openings and endings. But also OSTs :)

omg the goosebumps in my body

I&#39;m going to find someone I love whenever SAO comes to the real world!!!

SAO has a special place for anyone who has ever loved and lost a child.

„Åì„Çì„Å™„Å´ÊÑõ„Åõ„Çã‰ΩúÂìÅ„Å´Âá∫‰ºö„Åà„Å¶ËâØ„Åã„Å£„Åü„ÄÇ

Someone listening that while studying, reading or something else !?

I watched this anime since i was 10 and now i was 16 and still cant move on with this animeüò≠

That first song has always stuck with me

Me encanta!!!&lt;3

I really miss this, SAO Season 1 really made me feel something amazing I feel homesick but I don&#39;t know where it is, :(

this the kind of soundtrack you don&#39;t listen with your ears, but with your heart

The first one makes me Emotional for some reason

What is SAO. It is something beautiful that will calm your feelings and make you feel free. An anime that will make you feel like reality in a great protagonist. SAO is simply a deep feeling you have for him anime that your heart wants and will love forever.

idk why i&#39;m here lmao.. i&#39;m nostalgic and i want to cry now skhxcl<br>i started SAO when i was 8 years old so i kinda grew up with this anime.......... <b>nostalgia has entered the tchat</b>

music that makes u cry world record

Love or hate the anime, the music makes me feel something really special.

nooooo se los juro que me dieron escalofr√≠os solo empezar el video.<br>HAAAA ME DUELE ME QUEMA ME LASTIMA. <br>que recuerdos tan hermosos.

‚ÄúGood Bye, again and again‚Äù made me cry, not gonna lie.

Gimme back the original video!!

Simplesmente incr√≠vel...‚ô•Ô∏è

I love sao and hate the people who hate on it. It doesn‚Äôt make them cool but instead shows their in secure

I know my comment is easily lost here, but if you&#39;re reading this, it&#39;s no coincidence. Believe that everything will work out! This is just a phase, hang on! I know we don&#39;t know each other, but I believe in you! Rest assured that God is always on your side!

yui looks like sachi with long hair O_O

this music gives goosebumps

This was my first anime and i loved it. I am very interestet in vr/ar an i can say we are not far away from full dive vr.

to this day whenever i hear good bye, again and again i start to cry

the best background music

Gracefully hits different

the worst part about this are the memory&#39;s that come flooding back to you

A tender feeling is making me happy and sad at the same time somehow

the nostalgia is insane.

God I&#39;m crying listening to this because it was my first anime

does any body else feel the chill when &#39;she is still sleeping&#39; starts or is it just me

Just rewatched this with my nephew. The music almost distracted me from the show (almost) so good and nostalgic.

In the first Music It reminded me when Kirito First proposed to Asuna.<br><br>Bring back so many memories of SAO!!!

amazing. like sao.

Meus olhos encher√£m de lagrimas eu lembrei de toda essa historia linda de sword art online √© me fez chorar com a primeira msc

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=686">0:11:26</a> (At nightfall) makes me sad and at the same time very happy! Like everything is going to turn out good one day.

I really love this songs

I cant stop crying

I love sao so I&#39;m happy this is not any other songs.

2021 is coming!<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Still listen to this<br>Hope act Unital Ring will come soon

The first sound track makes me emotional.

Im waiting for the last episode  of Alicization because on the website im watching it appears in July. Im so exited to see what will happen next &gt;.&lt;

See you guys when some amazing person makes this a reality.

I know this sounds insane but I wish I was part of the Sao universe and could have experienced The aincrad Arc in <a href="http://person.it/">person.it</a> would have given me a chance to be who I want to be when it comes to sort and blacksmithing. And maybe, just maybe I would have been able to make some friends

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=603">10:03</a> the cure for any form of sadness or depression. Literally makes me happy every time.<br>Edit: my beloved music has been taken away and this upsets me dearly

I don&#39;t care if i died but being in SAO would be a dream come true

SAO... dam I barely found this anime and it‚Äôs already one of my favorites, thx for the memories and well.. imma see if I can find my Asuna. Bye :,)

who is in need of love and dating gets worse after seeing the love between kirito and asuna

I am french but is song is a best of The world !!!!! <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23saobestanim%C3%A9">#SAObestAnim√©</a> !!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I wanna go back to my childhood when life was simple.

l love this anime :.) and the song üòä

Everyone in the anime is so scared and wants to get out. If i were in sao, i wouldnt want to leave...

fakta gw :  anime pertama yg gw tonton selain yg dubbing indonesia itu &quot;SAO&quot;, njir inget bner waktu 2013 lalu nntn ni anime S1 nya kerasa bner hype-nya sampe skrng

Just believe that one day, we will meet our own Asuna and have the serenity of 22nd SAO floor.

Kocham SAO<br>Zaczynam pobierac wszystkie odcinki zeby ogladac za 2, 5, 10, 20 lat<br>Pozdrawiam<br>Jest ktos z Polski?<br>;)

There will never be any other Beautiful world like Aincrad and there will never be any other Yuki Kajiura

As trilhas sonoras de sword art online s√£o maravilhosas üòç‚ù§üíïüíï

I really wish this pandemic would end soon. The first music in this playlist, I&#39;ve listened to it on a lot of places every time I wanted to relax. SAO is still my number 1 anime in my list, I&#39;ve watched a lot of shows but still nothing beats SAO. It also somehow triggered my depression again when the WoU arc ended because it&#39;ll take a long time again for us to wait for the final arc to come. Oh right, the word &quot;final&quot; also hurts, which means their will be no more SAO after that. Ugh, damn youtube recommending this to me and making me feel more sad during this time of crisis. Sorry for being too emotional on this comment. :(

SAO foreverüòç‚úämy top fav anime even now

Tbh I luv the soundtracks more than the anime...sorry if it sounded rude....didn&#39;t mean to be rude....I don&#39;t hate the anime...I just luv the soundtracks....ü•∫ cuz it sooo good and calming

Amigo me escuche la hora entera<br>Me gusto una banda <br>Arigato

sao will always be my favorite anime ‚ù§Ô∏è

Kits like I m in a unknown mysterious space or forest and enjoying it&#39;s sounds

Ahh..thanks for this nostalgic memories.This makes me want to enter anime world it feels like I don&#39;t belong in this dimensionüòÑ i feel so aloneüòóso animes and video games makes me feel cared and lovedüòäand ofcourse music did the same aswellüòÑ(‚ù§Œµ‚ù§)

Its beatiful

Essas musicas me fazem feliz e triste ao mesmo tempo, eu fiz parte desse anime e esse anime fez parte de mim, feliz por ser bom, triste por ter acabado....

When ever I here the theme crossing fields I get nostalgec and want to re watch the series I just love it btw am I the only 1 who has watched it like 21 times this is my count EXACTLY

i don&#39;t understand why so many people dislike this video

i want to remind myself from the future that i loved sao so damn much

A tender feeling makes me cry

I remember SAO season 1 part 1 and now i&#39;m crying a bit

i remember once i fell and scratched my knee while running home just because a new episode of sao was out

Sword Art Online is the first anime i ever really got into. nothing will change the fact that this is my favorite show ever. btw don&#39;t die in the game cause if you die in the game you die in real life!

i keep trying to study to this but all i want to do is lay on my bed and cry.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>i love SAO so much! if it was real i definitely would be stuck in it.

i&#39;m not crying..... we&#39;re all crying

Perfect for study üòºüëºüèª

I will always have a mental attachment to this anime. <b>link start!</b>

I remember the blinds open golden hours me on my bed door closed watching this anime it really hits different.

Why do I feel nostalgic for a long time ago?üò≠üò¢

Me voy a poner a llorar

I do not understand, I have never cried in front of a movie, even the saddest. So why do I burst into tears in front of this video?

danm I forgot how good this soundtrack was

Ameeee‚ù§Ô∏èüòî

Epic I Love SAO

@The Soul of Wind Something happened to this video, the nice Soundtracks are replaced by something I dont even remind from SAO.<br>Like 3 Months ago the same video had different soundtracks...

Hearing that first song brought me to tears. Reminded me that I get to marry the love of my life very soon. Never thought that day would ever come, but it will.

good old days still crying when everything was so much simplier and happier T_T

so glad i downloaded this

Best anime ever

Aincrad is by far the best arc and I wish it lasted longer because it went so quick, I wish it had two seasons of just Aincrad ü•∞üò¢

Nostalgia hits me like a truck.

Its a very very very beautiful song

God so nostalgic make me cry

Be real if you had the chance to be stuck in an MMO for 2 years you&#39;d do it :)

Those pictures are all so cute

I love how I had panic attacks before watching Sao and since I have, my addiction has grown and now my brain thinks I actually lived in Sao. So now I feel lost in my own home which result in more panic attacks and yeah.

&quot;It feels like,I&#39;ve become a solo player again.&quot;

i cant believe its over

I remember the first time I fell in love with thus anime it was the best night ever

I wish one day a piece tech would allow u to forget something. Example: a show. I would erase the memories I had of me as a kid watching this show. Then my older future self rewatching it crying/laughing. Wondering ‚ÄúI wish there was a girl like Asuna waiting for me‚Äù the coming back here and listing to the sad and heart wrenching but beautiful sound track while crying and repeat this cycle

The first track is the best one

sao rocks i love it

There are a VRMMO called Zenith that will be released and I lowkey want to be trapped in there for two years.

Kids in the future will experience the feeling of sao in real life. Diving into a world, forget about the stuff outside, create a own world. We&#39;re born too early so things like sao are &#39;impossible for us&#39;

Who else misses when they were in SAO and even though it was dangerous all the memories they had together there you wish they can just go back

Waiting for my Asuna to come. <br>Let‚Äôs hope we‚Äôll have a nervegear soon

I feel nostalgic for no actual reason

Honestly I&#39;m jealous of him, even though it&#39;s a anime he gets to live in a world just like ours but it&#39;s so peace full and everything is beautiful

So many idiots think SAO is a gay, stupid or &quot;worst anime&quot;<br><br>SAO is a emotional gem that only specific personalities of people can understand. <br><br>SAO talks about REAL life issues, feelings and emotions. <br><br>Idiots would never understand the true feeling &amp; meaning this anime brings.<br><br>It&#39;s a masterpiece &amp; everyone here knows it &lt;3

Í∞ÄÏä¥Ïù¥ ÏõÖÏû•Ìï¥ÏßÑÎã§....

Sao est le meilleur anime de tout les temps et les musiques sont incroyables il est ind√©tronable

even tho it wasnt the best anime, season 1 will always have a special place

It made me want to review the online sword art series too &gt; &lt; !!! wear and use has been reviewed for the Nth time already :&gt; !!!

I feel so close yet so far away from the place that I have never been to called home

The first track really gives you tears

One day our journey will come to End, and we will leave this world and will go to the another world. Stay happy and POSITIVEüòÉüôÇüôÉüòÆüò±üòïüòÖüòÇü•∞üò≠üòéüî•üòµ‚ù§Ô∏è

Yo anyone here after seeing the SAO Progressive trailer? If they bring this OG soundtrack back, I would be so happy!

You know... It will sound weird and imposible, but thanks to SAO I&#39;m decided to study mecatronic (I&#39;m Spanish) and study so hard in order to recreate SAO I want to make this dream come true, I&#39;ll do it for everyone, I&#39;ll do it to meet someone in that... World just wait, and see

I love the first three songs.

Sao may not be that great of a show, but the music is and always will be excellent.

Cette music vraiment wawüíñüíñüíñcette music me donne envie de pleurer

SAO ost makes me cry everytime..

whenever i hear this soundtrck i would cry

Que hermosos soundtrack para gente que ama el anime de verdad

There&#39;s no part of me that wants that but I&#39;m pushed and pushed

This soundtrack make me want to go into SAO right now...<br><br><br><br>even if in GGO there&#39;s sinon...

im crying if im listening this soundtrack

I feel happy when i hear this soundtrack and i feel like im in sao, i wish sao is real

This is like Rdr2,<br> How much can we learn and enjoy from people than ever eXisted? Well, The EXperience never ends

Sword Art Online Progressive <br>2021

Retrouver la paix dans les musique de mon anim√© pr√©f√©r√©...

I‚Äôm here again!

Damn :)))

I have to see them again

Is it just me... Or do I not hear SAO music??

I wouldn&#39;t mind being trapped in the world of SAO.<br>Because SAO is more beautiful than my real world has ever been. <br>I&#39;m boring, my life&#39;s dull. If my life were to be a color, it would be gray. <br>Not black nor white. (Not taking about races here.)<br>It couldn&#39;t be those because these colors are plain but sharp and meaningful.<br>Gray is a bit of both, plain and unsure of what it wants to be. Dull.<br>Nothing to give, nothing to show, no meaning to it.<br>A virtual world like SAO would let me be the different colors I could never be in this world.<br>I mean, even a world like VR Chat gives people the chance to be different colors. A chance to start anew.<br><br>Just imagine how SAO would be. The day it becomes real is going to be one of the days I cry the most.<br>I just hope I live long enough to see it. Even if I&#39;m an old man by then whether it&#39;s like 2060 or something, you sure as hell better expect me to shout &#39;Link Start&#39; in joy before joining that wonderful dream-like virtual world.

Nostalgia &lt;3

If You&#39;re Reading This... May the universe bless you in unimaginable ways.  !Love

I finished the War of Underworld part 2...<br><br>but, I hear this...<br><br><b>I cried.</b>

I love Sword Art Online.

I Love You Sword Art Online

wait wait what happened to the sao ost?? i can just hear now relax or something music wtf

I can miss this song.üòò

Bro this song gives back so many memories when kirito and asuna got married, It makes me tear upüò≠

This song makes me miss home.

Anyone gonna talk about how the music changed from a year ago or am i just going crazy?

Sao was the very first anime I ever watched this anime will always have a very special place in my heart.<br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=2097">34:57</a> if this isn‚Äôt playing at my funeral I‚Äôm not dying.

This soundtrack brings so many memories when I found my Asuna IRL.

I want to wach sao again first time it was the best

I&#39;m not crying, you are crying

they really like the flute

I just got my girlfriend to watch this show for the first time and seeing her reactions to the same stuff that got me the first time was so amazing to see

sao is legendary

We may never visit this place but our dreams and our imaginations will

i dont care what anyone says. SAO was good! there was so many emotions for me.

this makes me more sad because sao might be ending

im not a huge fan of sao but i do agree it has one of the best soundtracks out there

I love SAO &lt;3

I listen to this everytime i cook ü•ò

idk why but i like listening to this alot more than the playlists with alicization in them

heart &quot;A tender feeling&quot;

I live with 3 of my brothers in my apartment. I really like SAO but I seriously feel like my enjoyment isn&#39;t nearly as high as it was cause all of them think it&#39;s trash. I remember watching SAO and thinking how awesome it was and then everyone said it was bad and I became sad :( <br><br>It&#39;s not just SAO as well. I feel like several anime I like I stop watching cause they don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s like I gotta watch anime alone now cause I don&#39;t want them to say anything bad about anime I watch cause then I&#39;ll feel bad about watching it :P

sao&#39;s haters can says evryth8ng but the music is incredible

i cry in this music

Im crying

who still watch this video on 2020 last September?

I love these, but favorite SAO theme song was the &quot;coffee soda&quot; one.

Hate or love SAO u have to admit the soundtrack is great.

Sao 2020 ‚ù§Ô∏è

I don&#39;t understand why, but it is great

forever and ever

Wow, i guess the guy who voiced this MC is popular, like hear him everywhere.

WTH it sounds so good in 1x speed and up

the og season 1 is always the best

Whenever I argue with my friend/crush I come here and cry to myself

yea ima rewatch sao again

–û–≥—Ä–æ–º–Ω–æ–µ —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –∑–∞ –≤–∏–¥–∏–æ.

idk why, but this feel like im in a rpg game instead a &quot;beautiful emotional anime music&quot;

i mean even people who hate sao have to admit that the music is pretty good. i know that its not the best anime in the world but it was my first anime and I used to love this

I miss when they were in sword art online.

Wow, I&#39;ve been sporadically listening to this video for almost four years. Anyone else feel empty/sad/bitter from listening to this? It&#39;s not nostalgia, it&#39;s something else. Like an intense yearning to have NerveGear level technology, but at the same time knowing it&#39;s not happening anytime soon. Can anyone relate??

2020 n if they make a real virtual sao game count me in I wouldn‚Äôt mind chilling under a treeüòÇüíØ

Wow.... The first one is the one i was finding XD

i dead ass was listening to this playlist yesterday and now its some random music that isnt sword art online. did youtube fuck this shit up or somthing?

–õ–∞–π–∫ –∑–∞ —Å—Ç–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ üí™üëç

Man I listen to this soundtrack and I feel this big hole in my stomach, kinda hurts for some reason... I feel like I have to swallow the pain of missing something I never had... fuuuck dude

When I listen to this I get emotions but I also ask myself this. Will full dive ever happen? I hope it does someday

I could live in SAO. As long as we got the background music. Dying there wouldn‚Äôt be so bad. Meet new friends and find us an Asuna to love and marry. Get our little cabin in forest.

Asuna and kasuto are like perfect for each other, also hot take I think Klein and Liz would maybe make a cute couple

This sound track make me remember my home - and my dad :((

Remember guys, don&#39;t preorder games. Wait for reviews first.

I hope someone creates a VR game to where we can experience SAO as a game

RELAX

I play Sword Art online integral Factor when I play RPGs I love to pretend like it&#39;s real life so I have fake flashbacks of me and koharu and our story inside of aincrad the floating castle in the sky

Listening to this is no good, just make you cry and feel bad for not being able to live in that world with a family like kirito‚Äôs. <br>It makes you feel bad about our real world and how bad it is compared to ‚Äùthe sao world‚Äù üòîüò¢<br>You wanted to live there even tho everything wasn‚Äôt always good!...<br>Am I right

Anyone who is listening this you are not alone and this fantasy world is real. If you are looking for something magical and feeling that living life is traumatic is because you did not seek for deeper truth. But this is not your fault. They made us to forget and feed from our negative energy daily. We came to Earth because we wanted to gain experience, we wanted to separate from the light source to evolve more and to help others. This place is different from places where we come from. Your goal isl to stop reincarnation cycle and awaken, for that you should complete yourself to feel better than the current you, find the highest form of yourself (eternal Entity).<br> You can do it in many ways. Just don&#39;t FORGET that they hold you in a matrix and your negativity is not YOU and the time does not exist. You are light üåüEvery life is past lifes continuation. Meditate, find people who are seeking truth about awakening, learn in the way you like without fear, enjoy not tv but your own  dreams and use astral projection to see everything. Learn abiut your chakras, feel your chakras, find out about magic and healing with crystal wands and reiki. All exists it is just covered. Grow inside by searching for love of yourself which is disconnected and spread that love to everyone else to get what you lost. Read about Nicolas Tesla, because he was awakened. This is truth and I am speaking from my real self üôèüå∏‚òÄÔ∏ènamasteüå±üíö

Even with so many animes today, I feel like SAO have something different. For me it is one of the best animes of all times in multiple stats, like animation, beauty and artwork, history and plot, characters, and that thing that I can&#39;t describe. I wish to see the end of this history one day....<br>Thank you that read my opinion, bye bye!

Did something happen to the audio? I‚Äôm listening to it after quite a few months but now I‚Äôm hearing continuous soothing music rather than the SAO soundtrack. I‚Äôm not sure why this is happening but I‚Äôd like it to be fixed because I really love this soundtrack.

YAHOO

Played it next to my favorite Zuckerberg, he is now making nerv gears

Sao a dream of beauty we all what to be there

Put earphone and close your eyes and feel the song ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Sao music and Hollow knight music is so peaceful

the thing is if u havent seen sao these songs dont really mean anything they have no lyrics but if u have seen sao its like they speak 1000 words

Still searching for my Asuna, i know i will find her someday, somewhereüòä

What happened to the music?! This was my go to for when I wanted to sit down and read the SAO light novels!

can wait for season 5 LIKE IN TWO YEARS

SAO is a story about a life I wish to live

Sick old times.....

SAO&#39;s ost is one of the few things I like about this anime, it conveys peace and calm, but can also convey feelings of tension and danger, struggle, adventure. It&#39;s really well done. KInda wish it wasn&#39;t one of Kawahara&#39;s first works. The plot is mostly bland, but the concept was really interesting and new at that time. Just spice up the plot and give characters more personality, and it would be much better. What was interesting in SAO was the &quot;if you die in the game, you die in real life&quot;. With that removed in the other parts, it just removes all the tension and fear of dying, making moments like Recon&#39;s self-destruct in the Alfheim arc lose their impact and weight. That said, the ost is unique and iconic.

just with the first track I&#39;m already forced to rewatch some episodes. Thanks, not like I had anything important to do, like studying for exams, for example.

Wish the Nerve Gear will be invented soon and SAO too.. Wouldn&#39;t mind the death game part as might as well enjoy it there and live to it&#39;s fullest.. However i think for something like that to happen we have to take matters to our own hands and end up being Kayaba himself in the path of searching for this Virtual World..

just your average solo player time to get back I  these quest. good luck to everyone peace

I wish current vr wasn&#39;t absolute garbage, gimmie that full dive üôè

The first song is one of my all time favorites. I loved Kirito and Asuna&#39;s relationship and I usually don&#39;t like that stuff.

IF you really  love SAO, then just study hard, learn knowledge from school,  learn biology, compute science,  we human will soon make a true SAO.  VR is just a transition, The brain-computer interface is the ultimate goal

SAO forever ‚ù§

I hope all those ost will be in sao progressive

SAO has come a long way.

Who else wanted what Asuna and kirito had there life seemed perfect in that cabin

I wish I would have the same lluck as kirito to meet such a wonderful accompanion

so sad this anime has come to an end

imagine disliking this video

Ah, so 34 and a half minutes of SAO OST, twice.

NOSTALGIA.

where did you find these awesome pictures/wallpapers? <b>~</b>

I am an artist. I am torn because, Yo, the level of detail on the fabric... And then you look at Asuna&#39;s plain face.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1205">20:05</a> in alicization... It was the sadness song that I ever listen

The day those two became a couple will always be my favorite part. And it all began to a S-class rabbit stew

Currently 3:00 am, this somtimes makes me forget im in the real world

Nostalgia

I like Sao though it does get a bit boring. But it&#39;s a good starter anime and the music is just amazing!

who else cried i did when i see kirito and asuna together it makes me cry

To be honest, when I first started SAO episode 1, i found it boring for some reason but as I continued watching it my interest for the series began building up and here I am now, I&#39;ve finished the series, well at least for now I have.

This songs make me sad, very sad ;-;. I am only who crying in anime &quot;SAO&quot;?

I&#39;m still obsessed with this show..... urgh I wish I could be trapped in sao

Me watching in 2020 Quarintine waiting for 2022 so I can play SAO myself.  Anyone else hoping for the same?

<b>goodbye again and again</b><br>i came here after they teleased alicization war of the underworld 2 ep6<br>when kiritos going to wake up

If I was trapped in sao I would never want to leave

anyone recall back asuna and kirito moment for the 1st track.gosh it make me cry

(Almost) 1k laughing coffin members

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8">0:00</a><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1101">18:21</a><br>Damn, it&#39;s the same song in fact

Makes me think the world might be better there than the real world is today.

I&#39;m not crying your crying

sao has one of the best ost(s) in anime history!!!! eh bois!!

Who else ready for sao to be real or that just me

I love sao

Is this video horror?  I wonder if the song has changed before I knew it

I don&#39;t know why but since I heard this song I really wanted to go to Isekai even if it wasn&#39;t there at least I wanted to go to heaven, and because of this song lately I&#39;m looking for an online game

People can hate SAO or whatever, but don&#39;t even think about hate its soundtrack

I HVE THIS ON MY PLAYLIST IT IS CALLED MY MIX WELL LOWERCASE

Y‚Äôknow, compared to how the world is now, I‚Äôd rather be trapped in SAO. No virus, amazing weather, a chance to be a video game beast and stand up for those who can‚Äôt stand up for themselves. That world compared to ours rn just sounds.... <br><br>Better

<b>did someone got the goosebumps too?</b>

I treat SAO as my family I treat Kirito as my dad and I treat like Asuna Mom and I treat Yui like my little sister, I wish that Kirito and Asuna are real I wanna hug them and I want them to be stay by my side forever.. I want them to tell me that I need to be strong and think about the people i love. I don&#39;t care what people say about SAO I LOVE SAO UNTIL MY DEATH NO ONE WILL CHANGES THAT! I don&#39;t want SAO to compare to other anime cause I know they will choose other anime not SAO but me even you compared My hero academia, Demon Slayer, Naruto, Darling in Franxx, or etc. I still choose SAO cause this anime teach me so many things in life so if SAO end I fall into depression idk but when I&#39;m feeling sad I&#39;ll just look at Kirito and Asuna face I&#39;m good cause they&#39;re reason why I&#39;m strong and brave I hope you will like this words about the SAO cause I&#39;m not only a SAOFAN I&#39;m also SAOFamily sooo I love you SAO...

Gracefully is the best!!!!!!!!!!

I want to leave a like to remember I was listening to

I wish I lived in a real life place like sword art online

I legit turned off the in game music for the new SAO game and it makes the game 10x more emotional god damn. I miss the romance the show used to have.

The best anime ever! I wish it could be reality. If the afterlife would be like this then im 2morrow gone from this planet ;)

I was here.

going back, i wished they really showed aincrad&#39;s floor bosses one by one lol it would&#39;ve been better

Let&#39;s made a new # for it to get more people thinking like me <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23makesaoreal">#makeSAOreal</a>

The original sound track is gone because of copy write maybe.

Hope one day that I will meet a girl like Asuna ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

sao bgm is god

The 22&#39;s floor, it&#39;s my dream

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1210">20:10</a> It&#39;s sad.

These keep getting taken down :c

After watching and re watching this anime 5 times I have a lot of negative things to say about it... but I will admit that the sound track is golden.  Plz understand my taste may be completely different from yours.  I thought that it was very strange that there were so many girls going after the main lead even after the two were in a relationship... Yes the competition was meant to keep the story interesting but like... why? lol  If you need to rely on a harem to keep the story going then there may or may not be a problem with the story. There was also that awkward brother and sister relationship the next season (I believe they were cousins).   I will say that the author was amazing at world building and making you feel immersed. XD  Also Asuna was portrayed as a strong female character yet after watching it again she feels kinda weak and bland as a character along with Kirito.  I felt like the author doesn&#39;t really have a deep understanding of girls.  All of the girls felt pretty similar, i think it would have been nice if the author built more on the world instead of the girls back stories, or it could have shown more chemistry between the girls relationship as friends.  I just think that this show doesn&#39;t deserve all the hype that it received but it&#39;s by no means a bad anime.  Just a meh for me.   Any way, hopefully I didn&#39;t offend a lot of people. lol Plz give your opinion! I&#39;m curious! ^.^

Life is just so complicated..  i would love to be trapped in sao forever

Question... when stuck in that game world was there an SAO OST playing in the background or in players heads the whole time like when in battle, or at home, or exploring? Imagine how hilarious and annoying that would get.

&lt; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1789">0:29:49</a> think tenderly of you &gt; is the best

Asunaüòç

Aku suka sekali sama SAO

Guys don&#39;t worry, soon there will be revolutionary technology that will advance to full potential. There are small selections of  organisations that are trying to find a way to full dive. I would ultimately love to be trapped in a 1000 percent immersive reality, that can have endless possibilities. Honestly I would rather live in SAO forever, this abomination of reality we are living in today is absolutely nothing compared to the God level of Aincrad, Someday we all can escape reality. And then someday I can relax on floor 22 in the cozy cabin with Asuna and Yui.‚öîÔ∏è‚ô†Ô∏èüñ§

Kayaba or kawahara reki world eally beautiful,now i can life at there every day,with out use neavegera and just with phoneüôÇ

Can someone pls tell me all the songs in this video!! I can&#39;t belive they changed it... I loved it so much (track list in coments)

N O S T A L G I A

A fuck this is bieutiful song ;)

I&#39;d honestly want to leave this world behind, even for such a death game like SAO. Life on earth is just so... boring. Especially these days because of Covid. It&#39;s been like a month already since I was outside. The sad reality is though, we are far away from Full Dive technology, and most likely we still won&#39;t have it for decades.

youtube purged the soundtrack?!

as bad as it can be as an anime, is sure  has a damn good sound track

I tried to stop remembering sugou torturing Asuna but I could not erase it. I hate to see people torturing Asunaüò£üò£üò≠

What happened...... it&#39;s different :(

Am i the only one who is sad cuz full dive tehnology is possible but people didnt made it cuz they think they wont profit?

DARI SEKIAN ANIME ATAU SEMUA ANIME ANIME INI YG MEMBUATKU SADAR DIRI NAHWA KIRITO BISA MELINDUNGI TEMAANNYA AKU JUGA PASTI BISA MELINDUNGI TEMANKU MAUPUN ITU SIAPAPUN ITU,,,,,,,,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>THIS FAV ANIME....................

i wish i could be in  sao..

One day, we&#39;ll find our love like kirito

the moment  fulldrive tech becomes a thing im driving and nerver returning.this world sucks

If only this was real

Can anyone tell me why all songs in this video are gone ??? It is a compleatly different video and the music isnt the same like before ...why?

If anyone doesn&#39;t want to be alone.. I got sick of it. I&#39;m alone. I&#39;m so alone i don&#39;t know what to do sometimes. I try my best to find somewhere and I get cast out.

2021,who with me??

Who clicked on this only for tender feeling

What happened to this video&#39;s sound?? It&#39;s no longer the actual sao ost&#39;s. It&#39;s something else... Copyright??

Sinse the anime started ive been really atached to this melody

La m√∫sica es la mejor manifestaci√≥n de la Armon√≠a que Existe

soy el unico al que le suena todo super raro y la separacion de cada cancion desaparecio?

I&#39;ll never forget this Masterpiece, this Anime. Its my 2nd Anime after Tokyo Ghoul. It taught me to never give up. And show me that sometimes, u need to at least take a break from games or expectations, and see the real world. Open the door and enjoy the Sun. And sometimes u will need to do the opposite thing. Ngl when i watched it, i was so hyped, the fighting, and their spirit or will to get out of the Game. Thanks anime

I hope neuralink will allow us to be in the anime world when we want, it seems more interesting then the real world it self

What happened to the Music??????

Ist there a MEGA Download? YouTube disabled the uploaded copies

why is this different from before

Well this certainly isn&#39;t music from SAO... but from looking at the comments, I assume that it was SAO music earlier, is it possible for The Soul of Wind to change the content of the video after release?

I thought i was tripping but damn they copyrighted this vid smh

sao soundtrack somehow reminds me of harvest moon&#39;s soundtrack..

Hablando de Sao ,  el final perfecto  ser√≠a el siguiente<br>Asuna y Kirito regresan de estados unidos, para darles una gran noticia a sus amigos y familiares <br>kirito ahora  conocido como el Profesor Kirigaya experto revolucionario en juegos RAIT( realidad aumentada de inmersi√≥n total) y Asuna  ahora Licenciada en Ciencias de la Naturaleza  Asuna<br>Kirito logr√≥ una posible forma de traer  a Yui al mundo real ( un cuerpo Humanoide )<br>Pero a su vez Kirito ten√≠a una sorpresa para Asuna ,  hab√≠a comprado una casa  en la monta√±as de jap√≥n, parecida a la casa d√≥nde vivieron juntos por primera vez en Aincrad, incluso el pasaije era similar.<br>Al llegar a Jap√≥n Ahora con un t√≠tulo respetable, su suegro le estrecha la mano por primera vez, d√°ndole la bienvenida a la familia Yuuki <br>en la cena de Bienvenida, Asuna le dice a todos y tomando por sorpresa a Kazuto,, que estaba embarazada, el se desploma  con lagrima de emoci√≥n y entre balbuceos saca de su bolsillo una caja con un anillo de compromiso pidi√©ndole matrimonio,<br>Sus amigos y familiares , at√≥nitos por dicha secuencia comienzan a aplaudir mientra ellos estaban en un firme Beso ,<br>Ese fin de semana Kirito la lleva de paseo a la monta√±as y de paso quedarse unos d√≠as en una supuesta caba√±a alquilada ,  Asuna al verla se emociona recordando los buenos momentos con el en Aincrad, el ve en la cara de ella su alegr√≠a y la abraza , dici√©ndole bienvenida a casa.<br><br>SI ALGUIEN HACE WATTPAD y quiere esta historia , por favor mejorenla , no soy bueno narrando, pero me gustar√≠a que alguien que si, la transcriba bien y me avise

I finis this anime and now im very sad

.<br><br>(So I can remember I was here)

Even if I would die in SAO I wold rather die there than here SAO feels better place to live and die. I need a game like this let me in.....

Y is the SAO Soundtrack gone, I am so frickin  confused.

It‚Äôs missing at our parting :(

I feel a motive to start a company, and try to make an SAO RPG game on VR, I know. I know it&#39;s so hard to do, and will take so, so much money. But I have a motive. I can do it. I believe. Don&#39;t worry. Not yet. Don&#39;t lose hope.<br><br>hi rhegan

Is my is my mother goose club out.

I wish anime was real life

Is this another Music now? or what tha f is going on

even tho people say sao is shit, i cant 100% agree and disagree on that. For me the 1st season is not too bad but I think the reason why we started hating on it is the 2nd season being a bit too boring. But than sao alicization just makes it so much more better.

sao para siempre

If only I was trapped in sao

not me getting emotional ):

The legends say thing anime was only good for the music

What happened to this viedo?<br>why the music changed? its not sao anymore xd

Escribir√© esto en espa√±ol aunque no creo que ning√∫n espa√±ol lo lea o le importe ü§£<br>Bueno en fin vamos a ello...<br>Escuchar la m√∫sica de SAO o ver SAO me hace replantearme muchas cosas pero la m√°s importante es que hago con mi vida? He nacido y me he esforzado para trabajar y sufrir? Para encontrar el &quot;amor&quot;? y una mierda! Yo he nacido para vivir mi vida a mi gusto no importa como sea yo no quiero ser como todos yo no quiero vivir en este mundo considerando que esto sea vivir porque para m√≠ esto es solo un juego si lo piensas es as√≠ : Naces vives te reproduces y mueres te olvidan y ya fin del cuento...<br>Pero... Y si cambio la estructura y si la rompo? Yo quiero hacer vivir y ser feliz morir da miedo pero me queda mucho para eso as√≠ que solo quiero ser feliz lo que me hace preguntarme como voy a ser feliz? SAO es la respuesta mira peque√±a personita que me esta leyendo no s√© si yo ser√© joven o viejo cuando alguien invent√© SAO pero espero estar ah√≠ para vivirlo y disfrutarlo<br>Tengo muchas m√°s ilusiones pero por desgracia todas son fantas√≠as a veces (m√°s bien la gran parte del tiempo) desear√≠a vivir en un mundo de anime no, no es por el hentai peque√±a personita ü§£... Es por que ah√≠ puedo hacer realidad mi mundo mi magia mi vida perfecta... Puedo ser feliz... A d√≠a de hoy busco la manera de ser feliz la luz que me alumbre ese peque√±o destello y solo consigo verlo muy de vez en cuando viendo anime o hablando con amigos, no vengo a hacerme la v√≠ctima, no, yo vengo a contar mi sue√±o y ese es, que en alg√∫n momento SAO sea real... Y qu√© yo Bon, y Paper estemos all√≠ para vivir y jugar juntos...<br>Y tu peque√±a personita que est√° leyendo esto si tu tambi√©n tienes esas peque√±as fantas√≠as te animo a hacerlas realidad tengas 13 a√±os o 40 a√±os va a dar exactamente igual s√≥lo importa la felicidad as√≠ que....

Ok, this anime when I was 13 was pretty good, but lowkey now it&#39;s kinda trash towards the end in my opinion, the sound track stays strong tho :)

ÂÆøÈ°å„Å™„ÅÜ

This anime sucked, but the soundtrack was gorgeous. That was one of the few positives. I can&#39;t wait for progressive to fix this anime. It has such great potential.

here the copy one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiGtWALMvtU&amp;t=114s

Is it copyright free?

Why did the song change? What I listen to is not the soundtrack from the anime sao

Asuna x kirito

God dammit not this one too

How do you listen to 80% of the track?

&quot;SAO is awful! Nobody can like this show, it&#39;s terrible in every way!&quot;<br>&quot;Then why is it so popular?&quot;<br>&quot;...&quot;

I&#39;ll be honest, I don&#39;t like Sword Art Online, the plot takes some clear inspiration from better anime (namely Berserk), felt way too tropey and amateurish, and the characters are the most boring, cliche, one-dimensional people I&#39;ve ever seen in anime, only behaving however the plot needs them to and not feeling real in the slightest.<br><br>But this music... It almost makes it worth it

Music does not reflect you even know what SAO music sounds like at all. This is more like Mass Effect maybe.

No song names or a playlist or a timestamp? Bad joke.

How could the music change? I decided to remember the past, I turn it on, and here this crap plays, instead of music from the SAO. How is this even possible? What is this virus, or what is it ?! ...

A shitty show with a pretty nice soundtrack
