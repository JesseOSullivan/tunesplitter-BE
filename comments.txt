This soundtrack, it makes me homesick for a place I&#39;ve never been

i miss the days when i watched this show, i was younger, i would sit on the couch during the summer, breez blowing through the trees and into my hair through an open window. i would sit, watch, and wonder when i would meet someone like Asuna in the real world.

Hate it or love it, you can&#39;t deny that Sword Art Online has some of the best soundtracks

Anime world: ‚Äúoh no we‚Äôre stuck in sao we are gonna die!!!‚Äù<br><br>Us in the real world: ‚Äú I wished we were in sao üò£üò´‚Äù

Wish I could experience this anime like it was the first time again

Two things we can all agree on about this anime :<br><br>1. Excellent Voice Acting.<br>2.Excellent Soundtrack.

1.5 more years until Nerve Gear&#39;s release in the anime, let&#39;s pray

803 disslike:<br>Laughing coffin members

I love how Kirito was fighting mainly for Asuna and how Asuna was fighting for Kirito

why do we close our eyes when we pray, cry, kiss, or dream? because the most beautiful things in life are not seen but felt by the heart.

i am trying to study with this music, but i can&#39;t concentrate because I am having too many memories

It just hurts when such a masterpiece I&#39;ve been listening to for a year has been copyrighted. It&#39;s so sad we have to accept it and can&#39;t do anything about it! :((

Looking through all the comments, I&#39;m glad there are people out there who appreciate this. I was very little when I first watched SAO, it was recommended to me by a friend. Within the first few minutes of the first episode, I knew I loved the show. I didn&#39;t know I would become a huge anime fan after that. I&#39;m older now and sometimes find myself referencing shows or copying what they do. It&#39;s kind of like, without doing that I wouldn&#39;t be who I am. I&#39;ve come very far in life. I went from being that little kid that watched shows in my spare time to a young adult who works their hardest. What I&#39;m trying to say is: I&#39;m glad that people are still watching SAO. I know it definitely helped me grow as a person and I hope it does the same for others as well.

It&#39;s amazing how when watching the anime you don&#39;t pay attention to the music, but when you listen to it here, it sounds so strangely similar. Love this!

I felt so confused when i clicked on this video and it was a different song. I understand their copyright concerns, but please look further and beyond! This was the BEST SAO ost video on youtube. They rather have no one listening to their music and implement their copyright than having people listening to this wonderful ost.

Who still 2020 Pandemic Covid-19<br>Still S.A.O forever

I know many people have said this and you probably won&#39;t read it, but this music truly gives me serenity. Thank you for posting it.

I dont care what people say sao will forever be one of my favorite animes

Essentially for anyone whose wondering what&#39;s happening. Sony JP have had a small crack down on copyrighted content. When this happens and a video is striked or claimed  the content creator is given the choice to amend the claim by muting copyrighted segments or replacing them with music from YouTube&#39;s royalty free library. That&#39;s what&#39;s happened here. It sucks but it is what it is.

SAO is just so precious to me. It taught me that in situations where we and our friends or family are in soo pain , it is our responsibility to act and motivate them through pep talks, our relationships are the things that we should care about the most. And there will always be people who are like bad mouthing everyone whom they don&#39;t like, but we should just ignore them and be confident in our strength , they&#39;re is a quote -<br><br>&#39;Try not to take things personally, what people say about you is a reflection of them, not you.&#39;<br><br>I know its a normal quote but if you go deep into it you will get soo motivated ‚ô°

There&#39;s a reason SAO has always been my favorite anime. Sometimes the story elements get a little silly, but I love the characters, the world, the action, and the music.  The part where people died aside, SAO is a kind of world that I would love to live in.

What makes sao so great isnt just the animation, plot, and characters... but the fact it emotionally hits more than any other show/anime  I&#39;ve seen. The people that hate sao have to find logic in everything done in it, and there&#39;s not problem with that... but if you come to the show only thinking about how the show has no logic to it, you came for the wrong purpose. Sao teaches lessons to people especially within  the teenage age group, and isnt meant to be heavily thought about because that ruins the purpose. When it comes to SAO you think less and just watch more, because every episode has something important to teach.

It‚Äôs sad that a lot of the OSTs for this channel aren‚Äôt here anymore. They should honestly say something in the title or description instead of having me excited to listen to some calm SAO OST and I get this

For anyone wondering what happened to the original SAO soundtrack for this video. Basically the creator had to change it due to copyright issues or something among those lines. It was either that or take the video down. Cooperate issues once again ruining people‚Äôs joy. Yayyyüòë

When I listen to this I close my eyes and wish I could leave this world and go to that one.

Sword Art Online meant the world to me, and still does of course. The first season was just amazing back then, and the first 14 episodes (Aincrad Arc) were so special to me. Joy, sadness, feelings I still have of SAO. These songs will always remind me of the one thing I truly wish in this life: &quot;Link Start!&quot;

I have bad gastritis pains from time to time. And when the pains kick in. I immediately put this video on and when I do. The music relaxes me and eases the pain away. And it helps me get the necessary sleep I‚Äôve been losing. Thank you so much for posting this up. It really helps me out physically, mentally, and emotionally.

People ask me why I am so addicted to videogame&#39;s and I simply reply with, &quot;I&#39;m not addicted to videogame but rather addicted to being able to escape this boring and normal life we all live into one with story&#39;s and adventure, as Kirito once said, &quot;even thought it&#39;s a virtual world, I feel more alive in this world then I ever did in the real world.&quot; In videogames, you can be anyone, do anything, a single blade can take you anywhere you want to go...videogame are not just a time killer for me but rather a whole different world of adventure...

This makes me feel so nostalgic. Back then I never would have imagined that I&#39;d be a major anime fan. But then I found a cool SAO bag and bought it, I figured why not watch the anime behind it? So I did and I&#39;m glad I did. SAO was so beautiful, the characters all have great backstories, the battles are awesome, the art is well-made, and the music is so heartwarming and it makes you feel all sorts of emotions. The voice actors and creators, everyone who contributed to this anime all did well, I thank them all for giving me this amazing experience.

I may never be able to watch this show for the first time again,<br> but I will never give up on it,<br>and I will never forget what it has taught me.

Youtube: how many ads would you like<br>The Soul of Wind: yes

You can say whatever you want about the show, but goddamn does SAO have a great soundtrack.

Is it just me or I would love to be trapped in sao too

Feel Good

Its amazing that the creator of Sword Art Online made the characters&#39; backstories so detailed and real that you know what made them the person they are. All of the experiences these people have been through make them selfless and caring like asuna and kirito. Loyal like Klein and brave like agil. All of these people have been through a lot like surviving the death game Sword Art Online and later on kirito in SAOII gun gale online, where he saves sinon from getting murdered irl. These people fight for strangers, their friends and for each other so that one day there will be peace for them and others.

I would give up everything to live in a world like SAO, even with the death part.

I didn&#39;t cry. <br><br>I remembered.<br>I feeled.<br>I feeled how my heart melted.<br>I dreamed it. <br>I love...<br><br><br><br><br>Sao.

I use to really talk down on anime. And then I watched sao and now I can‚Äôt even hear the music w out feeling homesick basically for another world.

well i just hope one day i meet nice and kind persone as asuna,never been so much for love but after this it just change my whole view of evrything so i thank u SAO willl always remamber u even when i get old

THIS <br>IS <br>THE<br>MOST<br>PERFECT<br>ANIME<br>I<br>HAVE<br>EVER<br>WATCHED<br><br><br>SAO ALWAYS #1

The people who think SAO was stupid can just go away. In my experience it was the best anime I have watched so far and I am definitely hopping for a season 3 :D

I&#39;ve loved this soundtrack ever since freshman year of high school and it&#39;s helped me through a lot... SAO was one of the first animes I watched too and it&#39;s defiantly one of my favorites :) Thank you so much The Soul of Wind for the wonderful memories and this beautiful compilation ~ ‚ô•

Oh my heart just exploded. I love this anim√©! I remember way back in my teenage years. This anim√© was a huge part of my life. Waiting for every episode every week. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I wish SAO was real * thanks for the likes*

The very first track makes me feel extremely nostalgic at seemingly everything somehow...

Listening to this is just reminding me how peaceful life can be, and it only took a global pandemic and riots for me to realize that. But in the end, just like in every fairytale stories, it&#39;s all worth it.

Who knew the sao soundtrack would be so relaxing. I&#39;m doing my homework rn and I feel so much more relaxed. It&#39;s funny how a show that&#39;s kinda dark is so sweet at the same time

<b>Me and my GF after watching Titanic</b><br>GF: omg, that movie was so sad, how did you not cry once? Do you have no emotion?<br><br><br>Me: <b>has flashbacks of watching SAO</b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Also me: <b>breaks out in tears</b>

Imagine if SAO could be a never ending story... I would watch EVERYTHING untill i&#39;m not dead. But everything thats beautiful allways have to end.  :(

This show makes me wanna play a MMORPG that is just like SAO :(

Who else is hyped after SAO progressive was announced?

When u realise Klein was born in 2000 so he&#39;s the same age as you.

SAO has the best sound track I have ever heard. And The song &quot;at our parting&quot; just rips your heart out, that song was used when Aincrad was falling and kirito thought he was losing Asuna forever. From the begining all the way to the new Sao aliciazation every single song and episode has been amazing. So thankful my nephew showed me this series and I can hold this love story close to my heart.

Always had people hating on SAO, but to me, this is one of the best anime out there, accompanied by some of the best soundtracks.

I hope we all live to see the day when a nervegear VR headset is released, and we can actually visit Aincrad.

this gives me so much nostalgia, one of my first animes i‚Äôve watched. i remember just binging this show on a cool summer night. honestly i really don‚Äôt understand why so many people hate this, it shouldn‚Äôt be a trend. this makes me wish that this game was actually real, escaping reality then going to a peaceful world and having joy every moment.seeing the beautiful nature in that place damn. thank you sao, you‚Äôve made my childhood worth.

How to ruin my mood<br>1. Listen to this song while I was trying to sleep<br>2. Ads appears in the middle of the video

my hope is still on my heart that hopefully one-day vrmmo will actually come true

I don&#39;t care what anyone says, SAO will always have a special place in my heart for bringing me back to anime

kirito and asuna make me cry. I love them so much

After watching the full season like 6 times, I never get tired of it. Any still watching this anime in 2017?

normal people: <b>puts on all i want for Christmas is you</b><br><br>me:

rewatched after 5 years and still the best anime i‚Äòve ever seen.. and the music is just perfect, thank you for this mixüòç

I still remember being 11 years old and sitting down and watching sao, sao taught me many stuff that I thought I would never learn.

Me: Okay lets see how long I can go without crying...<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=2">0:02</a> in...<br>Me: Okay I&#39;ve lost

This was the best SAO OST video out there... Been listening to it for years and it always brought back a sense of nostalgia. I can&#39;t believe they copyrighted the video, this just isn&#39;t right... They don&#39;t want people listening to their music? I understand the legalities behind things but DAMN it hurts

<b>this music makes comments more emotional than they should be</b>

For me , SAO is the best anime i have ever watched ... I&#39;m a big fan of it and i really love those scenes with kirito , asuna and yui being together and fighting for their future ... this anime got my feels and im so hyped for Season 3 but i hope kirito and asuna will be more together again . Best part of this anime are those first 14 episodes in real SAO and the music is great .

Who&#39;s here in 2019? This playlist just brings forward all the feelings I had of the virtual world. I may have started off by playing minecraft, and not something along the lines of Sword Art Online, but I can feel everything I felt when I first jumped in to the virtual world. The wonder of how it all worked. The tears that were shed when I had finally made friends. The love I felt for everything in that world. This playlist, it just sums it all up. I could go on talking about this forever, but Sword Art Online is a fantastic anime. I don&#39;t care what the world thinks. Bitch about the main character or plot holes, fine. However, don&#39;t you dare shit on the narratives that were presented in this story. Don&#39;t you dare tear apart the emotions it brought forward in the hearts of every viewer. This series has had such an impact on my life. In fact, it&#39;s the reason I&#39;ll be pursuing game design in college next year. People like us, we all need a world like Sword Art Online. A place where we can all be heroes. A place where we can all be free.

This soundtracks are enough to make a grown man cry

This is the video that i was looking for!!! thank you so much!!

Me: I fear no man, but that thing, <br><b>The realization that I may never be able to reach that castle in the sky</b><br>It scares me.

If the SAO game was real,it would be like a beautiful dream that you never want to end.<br>And games like this are a way to escape your real life and become whatever you want in this world

I wish everyone could hear this... even if they haven&#39;t watched the anime. This soundtrack is just so relaxing and emotional. It&#39;s just amazing... üíï

Thanks for your work. It&#39;s awesome

every time I listen to this I get that nostalgic feeling. This was my first actual anime that I wanted to watch and I loved it. This soundtrack makes me remember those times and is also a factor into why I play the piano now. I‚Äôm so glad to be able to play this soundtrack for others in order to make others happy and experience the happiness that Sao brought me.

I love this so much ! Thank you !!! Anyone watch<br> Sword art online ????

I remember watching this show when I was 11 during the summer without a care for the world, just chilling with no work. Listening to this music makes me wanna go back to when I was younger.

Video: &quot;starts&quot;<br>My brain: <br>My heart:<br>Me:<br>My memories: &quot;let&#39;s be happy and nostalgic at the same time.&quot;<br>Me: &quot;but your fa..k...e&quot;<br>My brain &amp; heart: &quot;shut up and listen!&quot;

I found a very special person in my life when I first started SAO. It was also the first anime I watched. I was overcome with happiness, sadness and other emotions while watching this show. And sense I found a very special person in my life while watching this show, it only amplified my emotions indefinitely. I could also relate to Kirito. Thx you Nightlight for being my Asuna. : )<br><br>Edit: And you still are my Asuna Nightlight, never forget it and I‚Äôm here for you.‚ÄîI will always be with you. I will give everything I have.‚Äî

Broo why the music changed. I like the old soundtrack

You&#39;ve just earned another subscriber!

One day my fellow internet dwellers, we too, can experience such a world, as Sword Art Online.

I&#39;m in 2020 quarantine and this just brightens up my day ü•∞

SAO is not only a anime it&#39;s a emotions.<br>I wish to make a game like SAO trapped in this forever.

can we all just take a moment and appreciate how much this anime has done for us, wish all 5k comments could meet up in the world

what‚Äôs good

Maybe the best present I will get today. I really love sword art online, Merry Christmas! Thanks for all the great videos.

Love this, makes me feel really sleepy! Also helps with anxiety! Thanks a tone! :)

Idc what y&#39;all say about SAO, I really enjoyed the series and the soundtrack.

I wish I could flee to that beautiful world without worries

Who was here in 2018 ?<br><br>update : I came across my comment 3 years later and I still listen to this playlist which is magical

I could have sworn this video used to have the actual music from SAO...  Maybe I&#39;m trippin.  Maybe both?  Still beautiful music though!

Every time I watch SAO, which has been around 4 times so far, every few years, I always cry at the end. It is so sweet, the journey of fighting for what you believe in and saving others. The stories of friendship hit way too close to home sometimes. I wish this was a reality, not the part where everyone died but I wish we could all find someone like Asuna and Kirito. Although their world may not be perfect they still work hard to survive and they find the best in everyone. I hope you all can do the same. Please recommend Sword Art Online to all of your friends because even if they think it is stupid at first they will realize how touching and amazing this story is. Hope you all are staying safe!!!

Seems like I&#39;m gonna rewatch it. See you in 2 Days!

<b>I know it&#39;s impossible but I wish SAO had infinite seasons. Their music is just beautiful and gives you a sense of nostalgia (well, all anime songs do) but still.</b>

i remember those times just by listening to the music and it made me so homesicküò¢<br>SAO IS THE BEST

When the first &quot;SAO style&quot; vrmmo comes out can the creator/developer enroll everyone, willing of course, in this comment section before the rest?! Like 2020 sucks over here.

omfg this bring back memories.. I almost cry at the first soundtrack..

Not the &quot;best&quot; Anime but I definitely can relate all of your feelings. Watched it in 2014 for the first time (also first anime I&#39;ve ever watched till the end). Then again in 2016 when season 2 released. Now, in 2019, Season 1 showed up in my Netflix List. All them feelings come back. I have goosebumps in most of the scenes. So many feelings. That&#39;s just crazy. Love the anime

Anyone here after Valve announced their Brain VR Interface will be ready for devs by 2022? SAO is almost here.

It&#39;s funny and amazing how our, human&#39;s creations always have all our feelings from the heart in it... just like this anime.  All the things you would want to experience the future and some possibilities that might also happen. But still, there are sad times but we keep on going no matter what. We turn that sadness and longing for something like this anime and run, walk, crawl and create our own paths along the way. While we long for something genuine like the relationships of Asuna and Kirito, we would inevitably cross paths with others too. I wanna be like Kirito, Asuna and everyone in this anime. Because no matter what, they never gave up! Even Akihiko Kayaba even his consciousness is inside that world, his own creation. We have a lot of ourselves created by ourselves in the past. As we time moves on, second by second, minute by minute, we continue to evolve. SAO is a big part of my childhood, it inspires me to never give up to be honest. As I am writing this, many people can relate... my emotions going through my entire body from my head and my heart. Some rain might fall hard, just like gravity! But even if so, the rainbow continues on... be it a thunder, hurricane, or tsunami, there will be beauty and peace, no matter what. People really unite when we have a common enemy and we see our true selves and even create families with people we dont know! Our true friends are true family, I hope I can be able to have friends like that. Who can handle my cringe, my true self, and my reality and fantasy. So go on, and flu like the dandelions through the sky as we leave our homes, we shall come back stronger mentally and physically. Cry out loud inside like a rain and make sure you form a rainbow. Sayonara, and I wish you good luck on everything you do.

just watched Sao season 1 &amp; 2.... I can&#39;t help but feel a little depressed since it&#39;s over for now, I smile so much watching this show xD

I miss you Sword Art Online!!~~ :&#39;(

Using these osts as my skyrim‚Äôs soundtrack is the best choice i made so far

Me listening to this soundtrack: <br>Thats enough to make a grown man cry <br><br><br><br>And thats alright

Great pictures and beautiful music. You Are Not Alone made me cry again. If you&#39;ve seen the last episode of season 2, you know why.<br><br>Thanks for the video.

the first song is just the best i have tears üò≠

Very interesting and good for me. Thanks!

Thnx for getting no adds in between. Love it

It is hard to explain but by listening to this, it felt like all of my stress, my anxiety, my problems were floating away.<br>I just love SAO<br>and it gets better with season 3 =D

Why was this such an amazing series? It&#39;s like everyone who watched it felt like that&#39;s where they belonged.

I just wish that I can forget this anime so I can watch it all over again. Sao will forever be in my heart

I believe this is the best anime ever. For the romance, and action, the perfect balance between suspenseful action music, and soft peaceful music.  Sword art online has everything the perfect anime needs. Sad deaths, and happy endings. The world building in this show is beautiful, and all the characters have a bond. Cant wait for a fourth season. :)

I saw SAO like 6 times and i want see it again. I LOVE IT &lt;3

The first one just drilled my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è I take SAO very seriously. TOO seriously. it was everything to me. Until dreadful episode 14, when they made it out. I liked SAO, sword art online, original death game best. This music brings back so many good memories. I feel like I lived there myself and my HP reached zero. Every month or so, i go back and watch it again. i remember the first time I watched episode 14 I cried so hard my parents got worried. (When asuna died. And even more when kirito did!) I feel like when I saw that episode, even if I could go watch SAO again, it was just ruined. They made it out. It was it. All over. Just memories recorded on tape. If you watch it again, you can&#39;t live it again I felt like I lived it the first time. Now its over. I still love it, but please, someone bring back the SAO I lived.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1908">31:48</a> RIP yuuki konno ‚ù§üò≠üíîüíî

Listening to this while I&#39;m doing school work and I do not regret it. It is such a peaceful listen that I could also fall asleep to it not gonna lie.

Kirito ‚ô• Asuna   ‚ô°FOREVER‚ô°

Listened to this while reading the novel, really helped set the mood, thanks dude!

This music makes me want to experience full dive VR. It&#39;s not coming anytime soon, though it&#39;s definitely gonna happen in my lifetime. And once it happens, I will be there

Thank you!

How can I be home sick for a place I&#39;ve never been, I really hope someone makes a place like sao before I turn 20

Thank you very much for making this. All these shows soundtracks are so beautiful. This one and it‚Äôs story line really hit the heart. Absolutely beautiful.

I am such a crazy fan of vr and everytime I hear something about vr advancing it‚Äôs reminds me of sao and how close we really are to something like this. Guys I‚Äôm telling you, sao is going to be a reality with 10 years. People don‚Äôt even realize it, I can‚Äôt wait for some developer to perfectly recreate the feel and creation of sao so I and so many others could experience it.

Soundtrack changed!? I have been hearing this for months. It sounds different

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=1906">31:46</a> you are not alone. this soundtrack makes me cry. everytime a soundtrack plays it reminds me of the scenes it used to play on, like this one with asuna and yuuki. üò≠üò≠ mother‚Äôs rosario arc is one of the most emotional arcs in sao ;‚Äî;

First song makes me wanna cry

Broooo, it¬¥s so beautiful üòç

I remember in March, I had nothing to watch since I was bored. I saw sao on netflix so I clicked. Little did I know that I&#39;d love the show so much. I already knew after the first episode id love it. And aincrad made me so happy and sad. If it wasn&#39;t for sao, I probably wouldnt of been an anime fan.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Thank you sao, making me homesick for something that I never had. And having such a beautiful soundtrack.<br><br><br><br>I hope somebody reads this, it took a while<br><br><br>Edit: I listened again to a tender feeling and I got absolute chills down my spine it was amazing

Thank you for making another Sword Art Online compilation for us to enjoy! ^^<br>And Merry Christmas!

i cried so many damn times to this anime.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>and only 1 movie was able to do the same thing

First song started and I cried :( anime has been such a huge part of my life and sao was on of my first animes I really really enjoyed it makes me sad too see all the time that has passed and how I will never be able to relive my youth and we all should try to make the most of our youth because we won‚Äôt always be around.

One of the best series ever! I love it so much!!!

I hope Kirito and Asuna will have there happily ever after.

SAO the best<br><br>Ahh... i hope this anime never ends...üëå

Whenever I watch the show again it just gives me the same chills and happiness every time, SAO is the best anime ever created!

2020 and  still here. We all know that first song on this list will always hit the hardest. Like damnnnn.

Remember when the first episodes of SAO where actually making you feel emotional and were so thrilling watching them for the first time?

the second song makes me cry and gives me the feeling of being away from home

sao reminds me of early mornings when the sun is coming up and there‚Äôs dew on the grass for some reason. Maybe it‚Äôs because when they were in the actual game it was mostly just... fields of grass that looked so peaceful. Man i wish i could someday experience something like that

This anime. This ripped a whole in my heart, and left me broken for months. I will never recover. This is forever in my mind.

Let your soul and spirit fly. :)

this made me realize that in the wake of trying to survive, you will meet somebody along the way, no matter how long it takes, you have to go with the flow and wait, good things come to those who are patient

Sao/Aincrad is the perfect world for anyone. You can be what you want to be. You can make new friends. You can travel into the unexpected. The beautiful landscape, the warmth of the all time sun, the warmth of you loved ones. No leader of the world. Just pure happiness. No sadness to be seen. Cheerful children running in the street. Friends always by your side. It makes me so sad to see how such a beautiful world came to an end. Everyone says sword art online is a horrible show. The people who say that don&#39;t realize the beauty of sao. All the haters are focusing on is the fighting or action. They dont see the beautiful world soaring in front of their eyes, the delight in romance. To see happiness everywhere in the air. As the real world once was, dont worry everyone. Someday i will find out how to make this a reality. no matter if i lose a leg or an eye in the making. The real world is crumbling away slowly. And im sure everyone would love and give everything to see sao at its finest in real life. This soundtrack and show makes me so emotional and realize how superior Aincrad is comparing to our world. Even if its a 10 minute look into the world. I want to see such a wonderful creation come to reality. Thanks Akihiko Kayaba for a brilliant influence on our lives. I wrote this long paragraph because all this got me into my feels. Im not fishing for likes, i just want everyone to know its ok to cry, its ok to wish things, someday somehow we can work together to make this happen :) love you guys. hope your doing ok during quarantine :)

beautiful anime, especially the first 14 episodes

This definitely brings back memories üòäüòä

2019? SAO forever  :)

SAO music in the backgroud while playing genshin is a masterpiece

I watched sao back when I was a kid and it still feels like a dream more or less, with how far technology has come, it might not be too far when we are able to create a world such as sao. I&#39;m currently studying as an engineer and plan on working in the VR field and I wish it to be my life&#39;s work to produce a reality such as the one portayed by this anime. I want to help people who might be bedridden and can&#39;t experience life like everyone else, but this dream is really selfish because someone close to me would give anything to be outside.

When the first song started, i felt a longing to go back to a place ive never been. <br><br>Sao was my first anime i started with and though i do have a few problems it&#39;s always going to be one of my favourites thanks to the beautiful art, music, and storyline.

&quot;My life belongs to you&quot;

Sao is the first anime that I watch in my life,sao show me that you could do anything if you really work for it.... eventhought a lot of people said that this anime is not as good as other anime,this anime would be my number 1 anime of all time.I would agree that there&#39;s a lot of other anime that much better than Sao but..... being greater doesn&#39;t mean being the bestüòä

Does anyone else just want to go back and re experience when they first got into anime.  I wish I could just go back to those days when things were easier

I never realised how nice the music in this anime was.

2019 people? Still one of the best. ‚ô•Ô∏èüíØ

you make the best sao songs ever

thank you so much, becouse you made this list song. I so love it

2018 still love SAO...

I was never right for the hero type of role .. I admit it<br>With my heart shivering in fear<br>I can see today&#39;s reflected in each past tear<br><br><br>Even so, it has been calling the heavens to me<br>But I cannot hide all the emptiness inside my fleeting heart<br><br><br>Once in my dreams I rose and soared<br>No matter how I&#39;m knocked around or beaten down<br>I will stand up, restored<br><br><br>All of my love has yet to wake<br>I know your strength is what I lack<br>You&#39;ve got my back and know that I&#39;ve got yours<br><br><br>I have you to thank for lighting up the dark<br>Because you&#39;re here with me<br>Our dreams will soar free forever<br><br><br>(I wanna always be with you .. I give you everything I have)<br><br><br>I could never find light to guide me through the night<br>And with one touch, I&#39;d recall every memory<br>All too precious to not hold them all close to me<br><br><br>It&#39;s tempting to close your eyes and turn from the world<br>But it&#39;s bittersweet, like you&#39;ve somehow missed a beat with no restart<br><br><br>When every wish has overlapped<br>You&#39;ll realize if you carry on with every dawn, your hesitation fades<br><br><br>All of your scars will disappear<br>I will become your sword and shield<br>This Crossing Field&#39;s the path that we select<br><br><br>The promise we made will last for all our days<br>If it&#39;s our bonds we&#39;ll live by, I will put my faith in you<br><br><br>I only need one miracle<br>Can you not hear me call at all?<br>Until that day, I&#39;ll keep screaming your name<br><br><br>Once in my dreams I rose and soared<br>No matter how I&#39;m knocked around or beaten down<br>I will stand up, restored<br><br><br>All of my love has yet to wake<br>I know your strength is what I lack<br>You&#39;ve got my back and know that I&#39;ve got yours<br><br><br>I have you to thank for lighting up the dark<br>Because you&#39;re here with me<br>Our dreams will soar free forever<br><br><br>(I wanna always be with you<br>I wanna hold you tight right now<br>I swear that I&#39;ll be who you choose<br>I&#39;ll give you everything I have)<br>/Lyrics by: Amanda Lee

&quot;she is still sleeping&quot; is the cause of my tears

the song really have a special  place inside me, recognizing every piece of notes and start to see this memories, what a wonderful music.

Try not to cry challenge <br><br><br><br><br><br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=2">0:02</a> I&#39;m done <b>crying overflow starts</b>

SAO was the best anime ever üòç

This show and music brings out soooo many emotions for me ü•¥ Makes me feel something with every moment. One of my favorite stories for sure, and I‚Äôll always stand by it for being my absolute favorite anime

Man this is squeezing my heart so much! I really love this anime....

I like it very much ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Thank you so much The soul of Wind!!!!

thanks you for this song of SAO arigato soul of wings

OMG I CANT TELL YOU HOW MUCH I CRIED THO<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>I CRIED FOR LIKE FOUR HOURS BC I THOUGHT THEY WERE BOTH DED , AND THEN WHEN YUI DIED I CRIED FOR HER BC SHES SO PRECIOUS, AND THEN HE WENT L0OKING FOR HER IN THE HOSPITAL AND THAT SHATTED MY HEART AND WHENEVER THEY WERE HAVING A &quot;MY HEART BELONGS TO YOU MOMENT&quot;, I CRIED EVEN HARDER. (i know this sounds pathetic but  I cry over anime A LOT)

Such a positive community we should really make a SAO server where we can all talk about it and have fun

Beautiful soundtrack perfect for studying ^¬∞^

THE FEELS ARE STRONG WITH THIS ONE MY SON <b>&lt;-&lt;</b>

Just wanna remind everyone that kirito didnt have the best life in sao. Ofc he found the love of his life and all but he still lost alot of friends back then. I saw sao for the first time like 1 year ago and I loved it. Ofc I got the same dreams as everyone of u guys/girls. Guys wanna be kirito and girls asuna. ( Dont mind my bad english guys ;D)

Bro these background music, it gives me the feels. I‚Äôve watched SAO like 9 times and man it just feels so nostalgic.

Me: ok study time<br><br><b>.  clicks on video</b> <br><br><br><br><br>Me: oh shit why am I crying

Nice choice, very relaxing. Good choice on the Picture to.

Listening to this makes me lowkey emotional ngl

I will always wait for someone like Asuna, Kirito&#39;s and Asuna&#39;s relationship was perfect as per my opinion.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=604">10:04</a>: <b>*exists*</b><br>Meanwhile: <b>*Sugu choking on a muffin and actually dying*</b>

first song i wanted 2 cry but i was in class i cant resist listening so i went 2 the bathroom and cried T-T i love SAO!

thank you for your work!—Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ –∑–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–µ–ª–∞–Ω–Ω—É—é —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—É !!!

It is listening to the first melody and automatically remembering the first time I saw Sao. What a good story, what magnificent characters, and what a great soundtrack.

&#39;She is still sleeping&#39; Made me cry, as it reminded me of Yuuki and Asuna. :(

This music is life !!! thank you for this awsome job &lt;3

I think someone is going to invent sao in real life. But I hope we will still be Alive to experience it.

I&#39;ll never forget those first moments when watching SAO. The moments Kirito spent together with Asuna, and the happiness they shared together as a couple. The moments when going to sleep I&#39;d always try and predict what happens next, and then the next day I&#39;d be happy to just be watching it. I don&#39;t know why people told me they stopped halfway through Season 2, I was determined to finish the series no matter what. Every episode I watched I wasn&#39;t disappointed, but even happier ready for the next. I just wanted to say listening deeply to this music made me remember those heartfelt moments in the anime, and the times I&#39;d never forget although they&#39;re just fantasy. So, thank you SAO Team for everything!

I think the best classical music is present on SAO

AAWHHHHHH ITS TOO HARD NOT TO CRY!!

Wow what a magician you are. I am relaxing and meditating with your piano and it&#39;s takes me to another planet and to higher frequency and next level before I die. I want to fly away again and again with wonderful musics like yours.

Good Stuff!

Thanks as always for creating such good compilations :)

This soundtrack, it makes me homesick for a place I&#39;ve never been

Nice relaxing music ‚ù§Ô∏è

I&#39;m distracted looking through the comments of this vid instead of doing my high school application. Lol, gotta get back to it now. Thx for the soothing background noise.

i love it

„Åì„ÅÆ‰ΩúÂìÅ„Å´Âá∫‰ºö„Åà„Å¶„Éõ„É≥„Éà„Å´„Çà„Åã„Å£„Åü„ÅÅ„ÅÅÔºÅÔºÅ

I&#39;m sooo happy that theres no ads!

Wow this takes me back to days gone by... such a beautiful soundtrack

<b>This song makes my Heart melt. üíò</b>

SAO is my favourite anime while i listen the songs i cry ;-)<br>this anime is so beautiful ;-)

Simply beautiful :)

Ngl, I don&#39;t care about what y&#39;all are saying about sao, but sao is what took me to the anime world and that it&#39;s music made me feel like &quot;This is Home, we can now rest.&quot;

these are beautiful song they make me fall asleep in 5 minutes and it&#39;s sad as well

„Åô„Åî„ÅèÂàá„Å™„ÅÑÊ∞óÊåÅ„Å°„Å´„Å™„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Åü

First soundtrack very emotional very emotional üò¢üò¢but all so awesome ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞

Can&#39;t wait for &quot;Ordinal Scale&quot;. Who else is waiting!!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èBtw the music is amazing!! I&#39;m listening it this while I&#39;m studying.

If SAO was a real thing I would kill to get it

Wow what a magician you are. I am relaxing and meditating with your piano and it&#39;s takes me to another planet and to higher frequency and next level before I die. I want to fly away again and again with wonderful musics like yours.

16 seconds and this video received my like!!! Amazing...

Anyone notice that this came out on Christmas? That feels special to me.

I love SAO, and this music makes me nostalgic, of the good old times that they where trapped in SAO! say I&#39;m crazy all you want, but i like it better when they where trapped in there. That&#39;s the one mistake that&#39;s been bugging me a lot. The story is called SWORD ART ONLINE they should be trapped in SWORD ART ONLINE! even though there is 2 seasons (which i watched) sword art online ended for me a long time ago. I still love it, but it loved it SO much more before. At least ordinal scale is coming out.

This is nice üòä

To me SAO will always be my first anime. I liked season 1 from start to beginning, everyone says SAO is not a good start to anime I disagree, SAO defines what people&#39;s imaginations could bring into animation, just like we have seen in Hayao Miyazaki&#39;s films. For me to put it into a few words, &quot;SAO is the dream I wish to live in&quot;.

„Åì„ÇåËÅû„ÅÑ„Å¶„Çã„Å®Ëá™ÁÑ∂„Å®Ê∂ôÂá∫„Å¶„Åè„Çã„ÅÆÂÉï„Å†„Åë?

I like asuna

How can I be so nostalgic for a world I never lived in ? And which technically hasn&#39;t even happened yet, since it starts in 2022 if I remember right.<br><br>I was already feeling homesick for SAO when this video came out 4 years after the anime, and now it&#39;s 4 more years. Jeez. Still watching War of Underworld though, love this characters.

You don‚Äôt want to know how much this music contributes to the crying I did while watching this amazing show.

best music ive ever heard

ASUNAAAAA-SAN!!!!<br>KIRITO-KUN!!!!<br><br>Welllp....that&#39;s my weeb shit for the day

Just over two years wait, almost there üòé

This deserves 10 million views!

I love the sword art online music that they use

I miss the sereies. I am eagerly  waiting for season 3 part 2 . When Asuna enter into the underworld.üòôüòô.<br>Edit <br>I watch this sereies because od Kirito and asunaüòäüòäüòä

This video makes me want to re-watch Sword Art Online<br><br><br><br><br>Edit: I am now currently re-watching SAO

Sao is definitely a good gateway anime for anyone who enjoys a good love story with lessons in almost every episode and family oriented. Sao now and always. 2020.

Wanna know what helps this epidemics quarantine better a.d more relaxing?<br><br><br><br><br>SAO! And this beautiful mix of the ost!

I&#39;ll always have a soft spot for this miserably written show.

Nice!

<b>weeps tears of joy</b><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>i can now die a happy man

Firs seconds all the reminders come by.  The sad happy amazing dramatic moments SAO made my life. I dont know what i would ahv been with out it Like if u too ‚ô•SAO‚ô•

me: oh this music is so beautiful!<br><b>gets an ad in the middle of it</b><br>GOD FRICKEN!

just listening to the music after so long watching the anime feels so different and so good that you remember the anime just with the soundtrack and wish you had the same reaction as when you first saw it

Sao touched everyone&#39;s hearts when they first watched it, so beautiful and with grace.

I want to remember that I was here so im leaving this comment

Man I just started this anime last night, 28 february 2019, from around midnight to 7 a.m, time&#39;s passed so fast and daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaamn I never thought I would love it so much. Those songs, those feelings we get when watching their journey  .. Gosh I will never forget how good it was despite everything we can read on the net.<br>You know this feeling you get when you start a new anime, and learn that it isn&#39;t even over yet. And that games also exist and are not that bad ? <br>Hell yeah someone&#39;s gonna spend a lot of money but i&#39;m fine with that.<br><br><br><b>SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY</b><br><br>EDIT : <b>OH SHIT WASN&#39;T READY FOR ALFHEIM</b>

This is music to my ears... TBH iwas a hater before, but when i met my bf he told me how amazing it is so i gave it a shot, and thats when i realize he was alot like kirito, he was very skilled when it comes to playing online games, and i was like asuna was  a little skilled but not strong enough so he helped me, there was this one time i mate a little girl who wanted me to be her mama in the game and thats when i realize that our love story wal a little bit like sao but we didint meet online we met at our school, so i am very happy to have him and our daugher

this show means so much to me man :)

Beautiful as always.üòçthank you.üòä I wish you a happy marry critmas from Germany. üéÑ üéÑ üéÑ.üòÄ and a happy New year.üéâ üéâ üéâ üòä

I love SAO ‚ô• <br>Thanks for your video ~

Came here for music to study to, now I‚Äôm tearing up.. thanks

It&#39;s just so beautiful and at the same time sad to see how so many people here in the comments just want a more beautiful life like in sao ... everyone really only wants to be accepted by other people and would like to have a partner for life with them one could live in this beautiful world from sao ... the fact that so many only have to cry through the sao soundtracks shows that this anime has shaped our lives ... somehow we all just long for our dream ... as sad as it is, i&#39;m glad not to be the only one who feels this way and i hope that our wish will somehow come true, even if in another life. i&#39;m a person who hates real life and so often I think to myself why there is so much hatred and wars in the world ... in sao everyone is friendly everyone helps everyone and everything is peaceful, of course there are always a few people who are just angry but that fortunately only very few are there ...everyone has this sad, weird feeling in their stomach or a sore heart if they only think back to the sao time. I&#39;m just glad I&#39;m not the only one ... thank you guys!

+The Soul of Wind I am relaxing, alright? How about you? I can guess that you aren&#39;t LOL! Well, it&#39;s good to see that the channel is heading towards a different direction :3 A happy 2K17 for all

Does this genuinely depress anyone else? Knowing that if you&#39;re a guy, you&#39;ll NEVER find a woman like Asuna and vice versa? Cos real talk that depresses me a little...

Thank you for song, its beautiful

This soundtrack is so beautiful, its peaceful and it help&#39;s me to relieved stress.

Love the song between <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=218">3:38</a> to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5jf1jornm8&amp;t=326">5:26</a>. my favorite.

My life is a joke when i think about the world they are in, im still waiting to go to the place i disire the most the place i never been but feel like i have been, a place where i can be myself and not lying to yourself a place where i can do what i want, a place that i so much disire i cant describe or the feeling of, it makes me so full and warmth to think about that, i hope i can be there one day and really life.....

Anyone from 2021? LOVE IT WHILE  STUDYING

Omg I just noticed I was crying without noticing so much good memories that never actually happened

its so beautiful I almost cried and the I started sleeping that&#39;s how beautiful it was

Luckily, I downloaded this videos

2019 and still the best Manga in my heart.. Thx god Sao exist

I think the selection of music of this BGM is wonderful. I was moved!<br>Please also exert yourself now.

I&#39;m rewatching SAO for the second time, and liking it even more than the first time watching it...<br>This track is amazing. The music is nice of course, but even better is how it actually reminds me of scenes in the anime and it just makes me so happy listening to it!.!.!.!

one of my favorite anime I love how kirito and asuna fight for each other and how deep their trust is for one another<br>how I wish SOA was real.....every episode has something important to teach.

This is a rare occurrence when I get goosebumps and emotional from hearing a song, the last time this happened was from Fairy Tail and Assassination Classroom

i feel like watching sao again

how did they even get the music this perfect <br>Incredible

pretty good study music right here, theres something about having this on whilst i study my japanese

I am crying now ;-;

I think the first song is from the episode when yukki passes<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23restinpeace">#RestInPeace</a>

Some bash SAO for what it has become. <br><br><b>But others still remember it for what it was. The first 14 episodes are never forgettable. It&#39;s proven time and time again with each reference.</b>

Ah this soundtrack gives me chills its amazing

Who is listening this at 2019?

I love Sword Arte Online ‚ù§Ô∏è

This is just damn beautiful.

I‚Äôm so confused. Why was the music changed?

Yay SAO this april<br><br><br><br><br>Corona Virus: Hiii

Love it, keep it up.

Anyone listening to this after hearing the news of this arc coming back again??

Wish I could experience this anime second time, like it was first time.
